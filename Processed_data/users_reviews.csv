Text_118,"i’ll start by prefacing with what pretty much everybody has stated before. 70 dollars is too much, and it should be closer to 40-50 dollar range.
new stuff:
joel can smash windows and glass objects and climb through, akin to part 2.

the camera has been reworked to be more dynamic during gameplay and combat.

the duelsense feature has been integrated to even feel when raindrops hit your head, and is an impressive display of the ps5s tech prowess.

the same dualsense plays a role in feeling the impact of combat. the redone graphics provide impressive facial features and some animation have actually been ported from part 2, notably during ellie’s winter portion or whenever joel smashes a window or door.

enemies will now do a 180 turn around during patrol (also from part 2).

the weapons have all been redesigned to allow visible upgrades from the redesigned work bench. the game came with the standalone dlc “left behind” (an entertaining story in its own right). also resigned with all the above. some specific character models from part 2 have been inserted for eagle eyed players (supposedly seth is in the game). the surgeon is also more overtly abby’s father from part 2 flashbacks. can’t forget about accessibility. everything from part 2 pertaining to that is here as well, even included extras and renders with an improved photo mode. not new: most of the animations you’ll see are just the same ones from the original, just beefed up with good controls and camera work. same with voice performances. the bad:
already mentioned at beginning.

i refuse to give this game a perfect score (as i don’t believe in them), but credit where it is due: the game is considered one of the best of all time for a reason and those reasons are all there, just prettier. it’s a fun game for anyone new to the series, but returning players should wait for a price drop or stream it on psplus premium if/when it’s available.",1925

bravo naughty dog! you've done it again with your incredible talent and dedication to deliver on one of the best game iterations i've seen yet. and yes, i know many people will dislike the price point for this cult classic being remade, but there is no denying the price had a reason to be $70. everything from the model work, textures, facial expression, and accessibility has been improved considerably across the board bringing tlou part 1 to new modern game standards flawlessly. i deeply respect the passion and effort that went into this and if you haven't experienced joel and ellie's journey yet then this remake is the place to start.

in scenes like when joe, ellie, and tess are discussing among each other you can see the emotion and feelings of the characters from when they speak verbally. everything from their nostrils flaring to spit being projected when joel is annoyed can be seen with great detail. it amazes me how the developers have went to this length to bring the the last of us back to life with small details like this.

take on the negativity surrounding the remake:

my opinion on the negative votes is that they are inconsiderate of everything else this remake has to offer and a majority of them cite the pricing for the atrociously low score given. so please look at the mixed - positive scores for more authentic and valid reviews as personal advice on picking this game up or not.",1432

**** the haters

Text_189,"as per usual(and expected) metacritic is abused once again as an outlet for the disgruntled who think anything they dislike is automatically objectively bad. i have seen dozens upon dozens of ""bad reviews"", literal 0's from people who state that they have not played the game, just complaining about the price, and even a random review from someone complaining that the pc version isn't out yet(how the hell does this warrant a 0!). this remake was controversial to say the least and i expected nothing less considering tlou tends to have a fanbase that on one end is rational and appreciate the depth and effort put into the series, and on the other end a ton of manchildren who think any little thing they do not like warrants a 0.

this remake is a 9/10 for me, the visuals are among the best i've seen on the ps5 thus far and indisputably better than the original by a significant margin, the environment design is flat-out insane and makes exploring, combat and other activities much more immersive when the places you traverse actually have interior and exterior character. the lighting, shadows, reflections, foliage, vfx, etc. all help to make scenes vastly more dramatic and realistic. i was constantly jaw-dropped at how good many of the scenes looked, and to think that this was all gameplay too. the cutscenes are no longer pre-rendered like the original, they're fully rendered in real time and my god do they look insanely good. the facial animations, body animations, character models combined with the visuals through the components i mentioned before make cutscenes incredibly more emotional and vivid. there are scenes where the performances of the original did not get through whatsoever that are restored in the remake, a big one i can think of is the introduction, where the scenes like tommy blocking the door to buy time for joel and sarah, or joel holding his dying daughter are already well-done performances even further improved by the facial animations of the remake that the original simply is no competition for. you can see tommy's fear in that introduction, whereas he looked dull and emotionless in the original. what helps this all as well is the amazing sound design carried over from tlou2, naughty dog really does have some of the best sound engineering in the industry and the world's sounds just play out realistically in all of the environments you come across, whether it be inside of a tunnel or in an empty alleyway. take all the emotions you had in the original and amplify them, that's what the remake does.

the post-game features are great. things like added achievements that were not in the original, speedrun mode, commentary, visual filters, game effects, custom skins for joel and ellie, getting to replay it with all your weapons, etc. make the game extremely enjoyable beyond just 1 playthrough.

why not a 10/10? mainly because of the gameplay. do not get me wrong, this gameplay is great. it actually mirrors a ton of the smooth gameplay we saw in tlou2 in everything from the much-better ai, gunplay. updated infected like the way more terrifying new clickers and stalkers, gore, the physics that react to you shooting, throwing bombs, etc. and the overall fluid motion of it all. things like the updated ui and workbench keep things clean and manageable. what i found to be kind of a bummer is the lack of dodge and prone. i get why naughty dog didn't implement them, as to stay true to the original(no, it's not laziness. after everything i've seen in this remake, lazy is the last word i'd characterize any of it with), but it would have made the gameplay much more exciting and intense. a big part of why they didn't include it was because the environments of the original did not suit these features, but since they visibly seem to have rebuild these environments, i don't really see why they couldn't have made minor modifications to the environments to implement these features. i also noticed the lack of small details that made me love tlou2 like the enemies calling out each other's names, and while the callouts in this game corresponding with actions does work much more smoothly than the original, names would have been a great feature to include.

overall, this is a 9/10 for me and is by far the best way to experience this game. this is the best way to experience the series as a matter of fact because the game is designed for a smooth transition into tlou2 thanks to the updated character models and small story details, as well as the ui and general gameplay. tlou2 will essentially be the same gameplay but with added features instead of remapped or removed ones. i understand why most people do not want to pay $70 for this. for $70, players like me who have not played in many years or new players should honestly pick it up. when this goes on sale though eventually for like $30-40, i suggest most players to get this, absolutely worth it if that's the price for the majority of players.",4967
