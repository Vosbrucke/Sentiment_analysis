1,https://www.keengamer.com/articles/reviews/ps5-reviews/the-last-of-us-part-1-review-a-recrafted-masterpiece-ps5/,KeenGamer,100,"there hasn’t been a more controversial remake in recent memory since the last of us part 1. since its official announcement, naughty dog had a near impossible task ahead of them. how do you remake a game that not only many gamers consider perfect, but already has a remaster? to make matters more complicated, this remake is a full priced game (at the time of writing this review) at 70 dollars. despite its uphill battle, naughty dog more than succeeded with this game. it’s not just a new coat of paint, the last of us part 1 shows the power of the playstation 5. it’s interesting to see the discord around the remake, but no one had anything to say about the story. there’s a simple reason for that: it didn’t need to be changed in the first place. with games from past gaming generations, of course graphics and mechanics will look outdated compared to not only the current state of gaming. but with a story, that has a potential to be timeless and god does the last of us have it. if somehow you didn’t get a chance to play this game and haven’t got spoiled already, you’re in for a treat. it’s a tale that’s a remarkable examination of humanity and survival. with as many horrors you encounter, there’s a good amount of beauty and echoes of hopes that’s sowed into its dna. even with playing this game once again, it’ll always leave me emotional and stunned of how good it is. it doesn’t matter how many times this gets remade, the story will always remain the same because it’s that good. what’s remarkable is the new way to experience this tale that i haven’t seen before. under the accessibility, there’s an option to help deaf players enjoy the story. depending on the emotion, the dualsense will vibrate at different levels to convey the character’s feelings. even for players who aren’t deaf, this needs to be checked out. it makes the story that much more intense. to not only feel the emotions internally, but also physically is on a whole new level. hopefully, more games adapt this feature in the near future. unlike the story , there’s some slight gameplay differences. it’s not big sweeping changes like having the dodge button in the last of us part 2, but still helps overall. in fact, there’s a good mixture of the first and second game that makes for a good balance. there’s a lot of fluidity in combat that feels less constrictive. there’s some problems that other players have encountered, but nothing in my play-through. while people have complained that the npcs are still a hindrance, i didn’t encounter that problem. now while not a difference in game mechanics, the controls add a whole new level of immersion. the dualsense controller completely changes the landscape of how you play. the adaptive triggers while firing a gun are responsive and have different levels to them depending on the gun. haptic feedback is a little more subtle in combat and traversal. it has more of a bigger impact in the dialogue, but at points you’ll feel it while moving around. a lot of great things came out of the last of us part 2, but for me, the vast accessibility options is at the top of the list. having so many choices to help a lot of gamers out and customize their experience is beautiful. blind, deaf or hard-of-hearing, people who easily get motion sickness, and so many more benefited from this. naughty dog brought over the accessibility options to part 1 to great benefit. it’s unfortunate that players who need this have to buy this particular version. as games like god of war: raganork come out with vast accessibility features, hopefully it’ll be the norm and not an outlier. just from the look of it, this isn’t just a simple remastering. it’s redone to match the visual continuity of the last of us part 2. the amount of details present is extraordinary to behold especially with the facial animations. looking at anyone’s face and in one instant, you can look at the weariness they’ve encountered. that’s the beauty of all this because just glancing at them and the player can sense their struggle. it makes some characters also look completely different like tess. the grislier and weathered features from tess are just some of the characteristics from the redesigned graphics. it’s not just the characters, but the whole environment gets revamped. the game has realistic lighting that has dynamic shadows and shades to it. makes everything look so realistic that it feels like you’re watching a movie. then comparing it to the original playstation 3 version and it’s crazy to see how much work they put into this. also adding to the experience is the use of sound in this version. playing this game with the playstation pulse 3d headset made beautiful use of the 3d audio. it makes the sounds beautiful while also very terrifying. you’ll hear the ambient sounds of the forest in one instance, then hearing the clickers trying to hunt. i knew the infected were scary, but hearing them in every direction makes it that much more unnerving. mark is a freelance writer for all things pop culture. he’s your number one guy to get on your team for tuesday night trivia at the bar. these are the best killers you can use as a beginner in dead by daylight. with this list, you're going to understand how each of them work. they are simple, strong and easy to use....

2,https://financialpost.com/technology/gaming/the-last-of-us-part-i-review-it-never-hurts-to-polish-perfection,Post Arcade (National Post),100,"naughty dog's genre-defining tour-de-force keeps all the original's emotive magic while adding a big dollop of modern visual wizardry when folks find out i review games for a living, the first question i’m typically asked is: “what’s your favourite game?” for a long time i had no real answer. then the last of us came along for playstation 3 back in 2013, and my problem was solved. a masterful blend of action, world design, and storytelling, naughty dog’s horror adventure is a cross-country roadtrip through a world obliterated by a spore-based disease called cordyceps brain infection, a fictional affliction based on a real-world fungal infection that attacks and takes over the brains of certain insects, essentially turning them into zombies. twenty years have passed since the outbreak, leaving the world unrecognizable. the designers used alan weisman’s excellent the world without us — a scientific perspective on how our planet would change if we suddenly disappeared — as a kind of reference manual in their quest for maximum authenticity. verdant vegetation is eagerly reclaiming urban spaces, bringing with it animals and streams that carve their way through the empty ruins. weather-beaten houses filled with artifacts of their long gone owners tell quiet tales of anguish and escape. picking your way through this beautiful desolation filled with infected monsters and murderous survivors – looking for scarce ammunition, scraps of food, and crafting resources along the way — is a terrifying delight. in most games, such a stunning world would be the show stopper, the thing that grabs everyone’s attention. and yet naughty dog’s exquisitely researched and realized environments somehow take a back seat to the character-driven story that unfolds within it. it’s anchored by joel — a grieving father who has come to live in the morally grey lands of survival — and ellie, a 14-year-old girl who may hold the key to ending the plague. he’s been hired to safely transport her to scientists still looking for a cure. it’s a tale of twilight and dawn. can joel, pushing 60, find his way back to being human before it’s too late? can ellie come of age without losing her spirit in a world teeming with things that want to kill her? a pair of unforgettable performances by troy baker and ashley johnson brings heartfelt emotion to these characters’ unique bond and eventual dependence on each other. think cormac mccarthy’s the road, but with just a dash more humour and hope. by the time the credits rolled on this 20-hour adventure i was emotionally drained, and instantly knew the last of us was the best piece of interactive entertainment i’d ever encountered. and so it was with excitement (and just a tad of trepidation) that i eagerly dove into the last of us part i, a visual remake built to take full advantage of the playstation 5’s graphical prowess. naughty dog wisely chose not to mess with the story, making no discernible changes to writing, voice acting, or captured performances. instead, the american developer brought the full weight of the medium’s modern graphical innovations to bear, rebuilding the visuals from scratch (and ever so slightly tweaking some play mechanics) to create an experience that captures all of the narrative magic of the original and rewraps it in the finery of ninth-generation console eye candy. make no mistake, the last of us part i is a gorgeous game. from wonderful little off-the-cuff moments — like ellie’s squinting, frowning expression should you accidentally shine joel’s flashlight in her face–to sprawling vistas of city ruins covered in trees, vines, and weeds, it stands toe-to-toe with the very best looking games currently available for playstation 5. rediscovering these environments filled with new and enhanced details — including faded fashion and film posters, debris-strewn coffee shops and toy stores, and rusting car hulks that perfectly capture the world as it was when it came to an end in september and october of 2013 — in 4k at up to 60 frames per second (i stuck with a 30fps cap in order to see more detail) with hdr enabled makes for an entirely new visual experience. while the optical upgrades are definitely the main draw for returning players, there are some other goodies as well. for starters, this edition includes a fully remade version of the last of us — left behind, the heart-wrenching story of what happened to ellie just prior to the events of the main game. it’s four hours of teens struggling to hold onto their childhood in a world hostile to kids, but the pair are also cautiously embracing what might come next as they come of age. it remains the most engaging narrative-driven game expansion i’ve ever encountered. we’re also given a new “speedrun” mode for hardcore franchise fans interested in putting their game knowledge to the test, some new accessibility features — such as descriptive audio for narrative scenes — and lots of great optional commentaries from the game’s makers, including creative lead neil druckmann. simply put, there’s never been a better time to explore the last of us than right now — perhaps doubly so, since it arrives in time to act as a primer/refresher for the pedro pascal-led hbo series the last of us — which druckmann is co-writing, co-directing and executive producing. the last of us never needed fixing. everything from combat to crafting has aged remarkably well. still, it never hurts to polish perfection. and this beautifully enhanced edition works hard to ensure naughty dog’s masterpiece will remain my favourite video game for some time to come.

4,https://gaming-age.com/2022/08/the-last-of-us-part-1-review-for-ps5/,Gaming Age,100," i’m maybe one of the few players that picked up the 1st the last of us remastered for ps4 (our review here) and didn’t even play it. this could be the main reason for my genuine excitement to revisit the lives of ellie and joel from a new perspective on a modern console platform. i mean this is of course literally from a technical and visual remaster standpoint, but also as a father, in which i was not one at the time of the original release. i think many will feel the most important aspect of this review is if the suggested retail price of $69.99 is justified for this the last of us part i, as there seems to have been a major divide in this leading to the release so i will tell my side based on my time with it. the original the last of us game, now almost 10 years old, was a truly memorable experience for me simply from a storytelling perspective. yes, the gameplay was fresh and worked well with a blend of action, stealth, and crafting, but as much as i enjoyed my time with the original there was not much replay value for me. despite having a multiplayer component, at the time i didn’t try it as i wasn’t a fan of playing online. for this release, this feature is not included so we are focusing on the single player experience. for anyone looking for our initial review for the original ps3 release, you can read it here. the first thing i will speak about is why the game will always leave a mental imprint on me. minor spoilers if you are someone experiencing this game. the death of sarah in the introduction when the outbreak happens was a gut-wrencher and i remember first experiencing that scene. this was just the beginning of the rollercoaster of emotions neil druckmann and his team would bring to the forefront. now take that, and now experience it as a parent of a six-year-old, and i’m in a glass case of emotions, and this alone is a point to revisit the last of us part i. this is the type of story that can have a different emotional impact and is worth retelling and revisiting, and on top of that you get the game rebuilt from the ground up which will be met with various expectations. for me, visually this remake helped give me the desire to go back to part ii after the ps5 patch that was added to improve the visuals and framerate. this also had me question why we didn’t see a full fledged ps5 upgraded release but now have one for part i. i bring this up because, at first glance, the sequel looks better between the framerate and lighting. this is not to discredit the work done with part i, but i encourage to set your expectations appropriately. the last of us part i is a fantastic version of a beloved release and in the world of constant remasters and remakes, every developer approaches it differently. here, it looks like the visuals and mechanics have indeed been improved and the inclusion of the haptic feedback with the dual sense is a nice addition when using different weapons respectively. as a single player game that has been released now for the third time, i feel many know what to expect from the gameplay mechanics, so i won’t spend too much time on this as it has not changed much since the initial release. the controls were always solid and the balance between intense action and tense stealth against human and clickers alike is once again faithful to the source code. during my 15 hours playing through the main campaign and finally experiencing the previous released dlc “left behind”, the presentation is best experienced with the lights down and volume up or headphones on. the atmosphere works it’s best when you are truly immersed in the game. of course $70 is a lot of money for any game and it is not new in the industry for this generation, so it really comes down to the type of game you want to play. single player will always be my favorite game experience and when you can play one with an amazing story, i find myself double and sometimes triple dipping in revisiting. (hell, i have played just about every iteration of resident evil 4 and that has been released in the double digits…) the last thing i will speak about is the character models, and this is something that not all games of this caliber get right. naughty dog has always been able to perfectly capture the emotions the actors bring to life and having the chance to see these characters with updated models is refreshing. in many cases, it’s hard to step back to a older game from a previous generation when you are spoiled with the latest release such as the last of us part ii. to be able to go back to the original the last of us with a very close visual retelling to the top notch sequel is nothing short of magnificent. sony provided us with a the last of us part i ps5 code for review purposes.

5,https://www.vg247.com/the-last-of-us-part-i-review-ps5,VG247,100," frankly, i don’t care what projects a game development studio decides to take on, and in this particular instance the handwringing over an extensively spruced up remake feels rather performative. my take: this is a superb remake of an already brilliant game that brings it up to the standard people expect from a modern naughty dog game. it’s easily one of the best remakes i’ve ever played. if you are coming to the last of us for the first time, what you’ve got is essentially a zombie apocalypse scenario, but we don’t call them zombies – they're the infected and they come in variety of horrific forms, such as runners, stalkers, and clickers (the latter gives me shivers just reading the name). joel, a bearded, gruff man, suffers a terrible loss when things take a dramatic turn, only for him to find ellie, a teenage girl, in his care as they venture into hostile lands on a delivery mission. naughty dog is great at creating believable characters, and the last of us delivers a number of standouts, all of which you’ll spend a decent chunk of time with to make them feel core to the whole experience. unlike many games that feature ally npcs, these don’t feel so much like bots, and crucially they don’t exist to spout inane gibberish. the official line from playstation and naughty dog about the improvements you get in this remake is thus: “a total overhaul of the original experience, faithfully reproduced but incorporating modernized gameplay mechanics, improved controls and expanded accessibility options. feel immersed in improved environmental storytelling, effects, facial animations, and enhanced exploration and combat.” having not played the original in about eight years, i can’t claim to notice every little tweak and change, but as a complete game this remake is everything i wanted. like most of naughty dog’s games, presentation is a key part of what made the last of us stand out on ps3. go back to that game today (or its marginally-improved ps4 port) and yes, it’s still the same excellent game full of top-tier interactive storytelling, but it’s not the showstopper it once was. the passage of time and the onward march of technology is kind to very few video games of the ps3/xbox 360 era, even those that pushed the limits of what those consoles could produce. on ps5, the last of us part 1 looks gorgeous once more, and as a franchise soon to welcome new fans following the hbo tv series, it made perfect sense to bring the video game that started things up to this new high bar. everything here has been improved, but it’s the lighting that hit me first. you probably remember that the original release excelled in this area, but it’s on another level in the remake. there’s far greater range on display now, meaning scenes have been finely tuned to a degree simply not possible two console generations ago. then you’ll notice the character models and world. “surely this didn’t look this impressive on ps3,” you’ll think to yourself while pausing the game and firing up a youtube video. you’re right, it didn’t – not even close. a burning house seen during the game’s grim, heart-breaking opening highlights the chasm between the various versions of the game, and from then on i found myself frequently stopping to take in the view. beat for beat part 1 is the same as the ps3 game, meaning you’ll experience a more linear-feeling game to part 2, but naughty dog has really done the business bringing it to ps5. the last of us has had its fair share of criticism in the past centered on its gameplay – in particular the amount of planks and ladders you need to move around, and the less than stellar gunplay. maybe it’s the fact that in the almost-10-years that have followed the original release more and more games have opted for this heavy, rugged feel to combat, but in the remake i didn’t find it bothersome in the slightest. there’s a slight clunkiness to certain mechanics, such as switching weapons, which i’d usually hate, but... at the risk of sounding like the worst playstation fan of all time, it works here rather brilliantly. this struggle can combine with the more tense enemy encounters to really amp up the stress levels. melee combat, while a little simplistic, is meaty and, so my stumbles with unloaded weapons often forced my hand quite literally to use a metal bar or baseball bat. these thunderous blows are just as unpleasant as the world itself and i frequently ended encounters with a sense of relief. it was all over, for now. if only i remembered to make better use of molotovs and nail bombs – the former being one of the most grimly pleasing firebombs to grace a video game, producing some truly nightmarish screams from the infected. as for those planks and ladders, well, they aren’t a huge problem. i’m not really sure what the hullabaloo was about back in 2013 to be honest. aside from the remade original story campaign, part 1 also includes an equally well modernised version of the left behind dlc – featuring ellie and her friend riley, before the events of the main game. there are also a load of speedrunning features i’m never going to use (speed is not my thing) and a load of new accessibility features including multiple visual rendering options, audio description and more. if you fancy yourself a bit of a pro, or just have too much time to burn, a new permadeath mode is also included. i’m staying well clear. much has been made of the 3d audio, dualsense haptics, and improved ai in part 1. these are all things that make this feel like a new experience, not just a port. the ai is the hardest to judge as no one plays the game tracking the movement of every enemy and buddy, but encounters play out really well, the dynamics changing rapidly depending on how well you utilise stealth. i played the game with usb headphones and the 3d audio is properly unsettling at points. at certain moments the tension proved to be a little too much, so i switched to playing with the sound muted for the sake of my heart. someone is bound to chime in to moan about the factions multiplayer mode not being brought over to ps5. would it have been great to see it here? yes. should it stop you buying and enjoying this remake? no. we know naughty dog is working on something new for a last of us multiplayer experience, so we’ll just have to wait and see how that turns out. if this wasn’t a remake, i firmly believe it would be right at the top of game of the year articles as we assess things over a bit of christmas pudding. the ps5 has had some brilliant games already, no doubt, but as a fan of the last of us, part 1 is my new favourite exclusive on the console. if you dislike naughty dog games, nothing here is going to change your views, but existing doggers (yes, i’m using it) will lap this up and appreciate the work that’s gone into it. tom has been in games media for longer than he cares

8,https://digitalchumps.com/the-last-of-us-part-1-review,Digital Chumps,100,"the last of us part 1 is a complex endeavor. naughty dog has overhauled one of gaming's touchstones, injecting more life into an intensely human experience while opening it up for new audiences and attempting to draw in veterans. the last of us has defined the past nine years of sony and the playstation. released days after sony’s legendary 2013 e3 conference, the last of us was an expression of years of work mastering how to craft games for a console. three massively influential uncharted games acted as the catalyst to naughty dog’s gritty, post-apocalyptic vision. joel’s path towards redemption through ellie is considered one of the zeniths of gaming and, at minimum, one of the highest bars of that generation. fast-forward to 2020 and the last of us part 2 is one of the playstation 4’s swan songs. to some it may be divisive but i found part 2 to be exceptional, matching the resonance of its predecessor and often surpassing it. naughty dog has consistently raised and often set the bar for third-person, narrative-driven games. and as players wait with bated breath for what comes next, i’m honestly not surprised that the last of us part 1 came to fruition. a year after the last of us released, sony put out the last of us remastered. remastered was meant to capitalize not only on the success of the last of us but on the success of the playstation 4. at the time, not everyone had a playstation 3 but by god were players flocking to sony’s new console. the remastered version of the game included spruced up textures, 1080p resolution, 60 fps gameplay, and select other bells and whistles. but at its core, remastered was still a playstation 3 game with a more noticeable high definition sheen on it. even by today’s standards, the last of us is an incredibly attractive game. in its later days, the playstation 3 was a workhorse that delivered smooth action and detailed character models. it was also a console that saw numerous hd ports of titles from the previous generation, merely giving players a chance to experience beloved titles with little more than higher pixel density. but it took a few years for the playstation 4 and xbox one to start churning out games that were simply unfathomable on the previous consoles. yet the last of us often found itself on the tips of tongues. enough time has passed where part 1 feels as necessary as it ever can be. certainly there is an inherent business decision made across most facets of this industry. if it isn’t going to make money, there likely isn’t a reason to put the time into programming all this complex code. part 1, thankfully, justifies itself. the last of us being retrofitted with “part 1” aligns the first game with the legacy and sequel it created. additionally, part 2 has been out for two years, giving it time to gestate in players’ conscious. plus, there’s the hbo show arriving at some point. of course, naughty dog teased a separate online-based entry in the series but who knows when that will arrive. the last of us part 1 is poised to gobble up new and old players alike. the question, however, is will it? let’s just get the ugly stuff out of the way. most eyes will water at part 1‘s $70 price tag and justifiably so. i’m not often callous enough to bring in the specter of value when reviewing games and while i’m plenty cynical, not so much that i will label part 1 a 10-year-old game with a 1-year-old game’s price tag. but there are certainly those who at least know the legacy of the last of us and its place in time and wonder why part 1 costs the same as horizon: forbidden west. oh, and the multiplayer component of the last of us isn’t here, which is a bummer because it was awesome. final fantasy 7 remake took a title over two decades old and built a nearly unrecognizable game from it. the last of us part 1 is not doing the same heavy lifting. but in this scenario, the last of us not only still works within modern sensibilities, it doesn’t need to say or do anything new. the original final fantasy 7 remains a classic but also has room for reinterpretation with character models, dialog, and story beats. with part 1, naughty dog asks, “what if virtually everyone can enjoy this medium-defining experience and it looks and feels almost as good as part 2?” technology, like time, moves fast. some might say technology moves faster. i could never imagine watching joel’s unyielding grief play out with a blocky, polygonal model on the playstation 1, as interesting as that might be to see. when the the last of us arrived, i had been conditioned to expect a lot out of naughty dog’s performance capture and attention to detail. nathan drake and his charming ways were made more infectious by capturing nolan north’s actual performances. but with the last of us, that kind of bombastic delivery and exaggerated movement was replaced with subtle pain and muted fury. to this day, there are only a handful of games with this production value that have matched the writing, directing, and acting of the last of us. a game told across one moment 20 years ago and then four seasons. the world has been ravaged by the cordyceps fungus that infects the flesh and turns people into mindless monsters. what remains are the broken and battered pockets of civilization that primarily look out for themselves. the last of us sees joel, a damaged father haunted by his past, lead the young ellie through destroyed american cities towards potential salvation. the pair meet others along the way–both hostile and friendly–all while avoiding infected, mutated humans. troy baker and ashley johnson’s performances are in the pantheon of voice acting to this day, giving joel and ellie the weight of this bleak world. neil druckmann and bruce strayley’s direction weave action and drama expertly while druckmann’s writing punches at the player’s emotional core. by the end of the last of us, players are likely to feel as weary and raw as those who remain. commentary on the lengths we will go for loved ones or who the real monsters are will pop up. the game is thematically, narratively, and mechanically dense. each element coalesces in a way that broke ground in 2013 and remains a standard today. the desperate hunt for supplies to build tools for survival made sense in the world and for gameplay. terrifying encounters with clickers would be broken up with calm moments of discovery or cascade into new feelings of dread. the last of us often blurred the lines between a traditional “fun” video game, a movie, and a powerful expression of entertainment. it is difficult to not to reminisce about the game’s impact since it first launched. even harder not to delve into the complexities of its relation to the sequel. now, imagine those experiences transplanted to the last of us part 2‘s fidelity. that, in essence, is what the last of us part 1 has to offer. naughty dog has worked to put the last of us‘ visuals on par with that of part 2. with part 1, players new and old should be swept up by the game’s beauty. as a caveat, don’t expect the sheer density and realism of something like forbidden west or the upcoming god of war ragnarok. after all, this is using an engine that was nearly perfected in 2020 and eked out as much playstation 4 pro power as possible. part 1 is an exceptional take on the last of us. it doesn’t “reimagine” the game’s world and characters, it truly defines them. even with the limitations of the playstation 3, the dilapidation of the last of us was expressive. the darkest, rain-soaked, bombed-out buildings were packed with detail and the lushest vegetation pierced through the crumbling cement. now, those environments are given new life and new details. one unfortunate thing when attempting to compare the visuals of the original game and part 1 is that a player would literally have to have both games running side by side to truly see the extent of the updates. throughout my time with part 1, i would scurry over to youtube in hopes of piecing together differences by watching other playthroughs. sony has smartly done a few comparison videos to express changes made. though i have no doubt the original game is what naughty dog wanted to make, part 1 allows them to really expand on that vision. imagine the special editions of star wars without going off the rails. environments have assets, details, and depth like never before. as joel and crew flee the city in the rain, the world isn’t as swamped in unrecognizable darkness. skylines have deeper draw distances. abandoned streets feature buildings with more bountiful signage. little things popped out to me, like joel’s broken watch being heartbreakingly readable at all times. having only played through the last of us twice–once on playstation 3 and right when remastered came out–my memory of the finer points of the game are a bit hazy. personally, i would not be able to explore a level or engage in a fight and readily identify what exactly was different. but i knew what felt different and that was the game’s atmosphere and its characters. not that they were altered in any negative way, just that they were easier to soak up. for example, tess’ new character model is the first stark contrast from the original that shows where part 1 excels. meant to more closely capture the voice actor’s performance, the new model for tess is expressive and shows signs of living in this violent world. joel, ellie, and tommy are designed to more closely represent their part 2 counterparts and it feels less drastic than the shift from uncharted 3 to uncharted 4. the updated character models allow performances across the board to improve. players can watch as clothing wrinkles, neck muscles tense, and spit flies during a shout. part 2 was a masterpiece in terms of cinematic performances and part 1 edges so close to that. yes, i could still see some of the game’s age but it absolutely felt more natural. what this amounts to is almost perfecting the vast array of emotional deliveries the last of us has. part 1 manages to not only preserve the original experience but future-proof it. part 1 and part 2 can gleefully stand next to each other as generational bookends. it would have been strange for naughty dog to create part 1 with the goal of fundamentally changing any aspect of the last of us. but as players make their way through the game, it’s obvious the goal was simply to make the game as accessible and as jaw-dropping as part 2, while introducing some playstation 5 flourishes. accessibility options are a feature i appreciate but not one i take much advantage of. but as huds become increasingly busy, i’ve been praising games that allow players to adjust the size of subtitles and certain hud elements so they are easier to see from far distances without requiring an entirely new television. but the suite of accessibility options in part 1 trump what was seen in part 2 and similar releases. naughty dog wants to allow any willing player to experience the game, one way or another. deaf players can feel the intensity of a conversation by allowing the dualsense to vibrate with the spoken dialog. hushed utterances will result in small haptic vibrations while yells and shouts make the entire controller rumble. it’s a novel idea and one that i employed on my playthrough because it simply allowed for further immersion. players who need visual aids have a range of high-contrast options that highlight objects, enemies, and characters in bright colors and grey out the world. listen mode can be altered to ping enemies through walls and farther than normal. descriptive audio will allow further narration in cutscenes to detail what characters are doing and what is happening in the scene for players who need that kind of aid. with part 1, naughty dog does not want a video game’s fundamentals–gameplay, graphics, and audio–to hinder the experience. the last of us was more than just a game, it was a cinematic experience only accomplished through the medium. these new options thin the barrier of entry if not destroy it altogether for many players. one shortcoming of part 1 is that it inevitably cannot play like part 2. joel cannot go prone, there’s no crawling or ropes or any of the new things seen in the sequel. but any attempt to replicate those evolved gameplay moments would have required naughty dog to completely rethink and remake most of the combat encounters in the last of us, therefore altering what wasn’t necessarily broken in the first place. part 1 tweaks enemy ai and makes friendlies less likely to run around during stealth and break immersion. but i already found the last of us‘ gameplay to be quite exceptional. if anything, the polished animations and visuals only make it feel better than before. then who, ultimately, is the last of us part 1 for? at the highest level, part 1 is for players who have never touched either game, own a playstation 5, and want to play one of the definitive games of the last three generations. from there, i think those who have only played the last of us once or twice like myself will get a lot of mileage out of part 1‘s fresh face, especially since i never tried out the left behind dlc which also gets all the enhancements. veterans of the series may lament the lack of multiplayer getting the glow up but are bound to appreciate the finer details that are lost upon those with less experience. so, in a way, the last of us part 1 is for everyone. an argument can be made about how “necessary” part 1 is. does a game this new, this beloved need to be touched? perhaps not. regardless, that doesn’t take away from how important the additions of part 1 are to the core experience of the last of us and how preserved the game now feels with minimal alterations to its core meaning and message. it has the same impact and perhaps it will have a deeper impact to newcomers and what is wrong with that? the last of us part 1 is the definitive version of one of our medium’s defining works. nine years ago naughty dog crafted a masterpiece. now, they have updated it for slightly more modern sensibilities, putting part 1 in line with the last of us part 2. the wealth of accessibility options remove numerous barriers of entry for players so that an even wider audience can appreciate this story of loss and triumph. the emotional gut punches sting even harder with overhauled visuals, bringing these tragic characters closer than ever to their astounding real-life performances. the last of us part 1 is the timeless game we have all loved for years, now shining in an even brighter light.

9,https://www.nme.com/reviews/game-reviews/the-last-of-us-part-1-review-3301663,NME,100,"remaking naughty dog’s seminal survival story has proved to be a worthwhile endeavour the last of us, a 2013 action-adventure that has spawned a remaster, an acclaimed sequel, and an hbo television series, is one of the most revered video games of all time. almost ten years later, in the wake of the 2020 sequel the last of us part 2, developer naughty dog has delivered a remake to bring it in line with that game’s meticulous quality. unsurprisingly, this has proved controversial. the last of us part 1 is a full-price game, and the remastered version is still in excellent condition on ps4 & ps5. this meant i went in with some level of scepticism about its necessity, but to my surprise, the last of us part 1 proved itself to be a worthwhile endeavour very quickly, and not in all the obvious ways you might expect. of course, it looks a lot better. part 2 character models have been swapped in, and exclusive side characters have been thoughtfully reimagined, shunting the game’s cast a few notches forward with regard to emotional range and subtlety. the way mouths curve and faces quiver to react to bad news feels miles better. ellie’s frustration at learning how to whistle, joel’s emotional poker face, david’s manipulative streak and the way bill talks like he’s got spit in his mouth when the crew are running from a horde…these are just a few pieces of memorable performance that feel elevated in this remake. but it’s not all perfect – at times, you can tell that the technology is trying to account for the decade-old face mocap. characters can’t quite reach the depth of part 2’s performances, but it certainly feels more faithful to the script’s intention than the original game. for example, i knew exactly what would happen in the game’s legendary opening but still felt that strong surge of adrenaline, the frog in my throat, and bawled my eyes out at the end of it. there’s a desperation to the new animations and a particular resonance in how it grounds you as you’re sitting in a reversing car trying to escape unbridled chaos and certain death. distance from the original game and the amount that it’s been kept in the critical conversation has, to my absolute surprise, not cheapened the power of the last of us. it’s by no means a quaint trip down memory lane – it still hits harder than a bloater in a gym hall. the last of us part 2 has played with the overarching narrative of the last of us, too, revealing flashback truths and delivering shocking moments that have had retroactive ripple effects throughout the original game. this made the experience even more thrilling when there was room for analogy, like in tess and joel’s dogged pursuit of robert, tommy’s relationship with maria, ellie’s drowning and revival, and the warring fireflies. reassessing the remake has also inevitably led to some revelations about what the original did so right. one of the most impressive parts of its narrative is how it escaped the marvel-ization of everything that has pervaded and degraded most modern big-budget games and movies. there’s a scene where ellie, joel and bill get to a house after a long, harrowing chase, and ellie quips, “well, that went well”. while this feels in character for this hopeful, hardened young girl in an apocalypse, joel just glares at her, and they all quickly move on. there’s a refreshing seriousness to how it treats death and grief, too. moments of loss aren’t hammy and played up for the benefit of producers, they usually just are, like in reality, and it hurts. i had forgotten the beats of the sam and henry story arc, which benefits significantly in the remake, especially when you get to see ellie and sam bonding and encountering the remnants of humanity. the rationality of the sheltering older brother and the kid who just wants to be a kid still proves to be a powerful device in a game like the last of us. it’s a brilliant story at its very best here. while it is missing the dodge and prone mechanics of the second game, most of part 2’s combat has been transferred over wholesale, as well as its remarkable enemy ai. encounters feel guttural, your tactics exploited and composure ready to crumble at any moment. i thought i’d breeze through due to familiarity with its systems, but while your companions are more intelligent, the last of us feels more challenging and haptic this time around. it works to ground you in its atmosphere as joel clubs and stabs his way through legions of enemies that are just as desperate or frenzied as him. thanks to the dualsense, you can also feel the heft of a shotgun blast or a nail bomb in your hands before it deals damage. speaking of which, the gore is another point of improvement. reflective pools of blood leak carefully from your enemies, and limbs fly after explosions. the brutality has gone up a measure, so there’s more room to ponder the cyclical nature of the game’s violence and the morally murky choices made to protect one’s own. the way car windows pop as brutish enemies surge towards joel and push him back into the darkness with buckshot creates palpable adrenaline, and environments like the boston museum provide readable historical context alongside tense stealth battles and inevitable smashed exhibits. the repetitive ladder puzzles started to grate a little, sure, but naughty dog’s determination to preserve and improve the experience means they have to stay, i guess. in more natural areas, there’s improved foliage, rippling tarps and a stunning lighting system that sings as your dodgy flashlight shines through a spore-filled room. room layouts stay mostly the same, with a few sensible changes made to account for workbenches and collectable placement. i think because the industry has just accepted the last of us to be this pedestalled titan, you forgot about all of the new ground it was breaking, which is teased out and given focus in the remake. the way it toys with mechanics is fascinating, like how ellie won’t come to joel for a leg-up when she’s sad and how she learns to stop gasping after she experiences a grisly death in combat or hears a terrifying sniper shot in the distance. you slowly watch her become the warrior she is in the second game, and for fans of the series, this will feel far more resonant than a replay. and once you’re done, there’s plenty of cute cosmetics, concept art, commentary, and a ridiculously intricate photo mode to dig into to memorialise your return. the last of us part 1 is a remarkable remake that proves its worth very quickly. it is carefully faithful to the original script but passionately keen to improve the experience where it can, by honing in on the emotional resonance of its most effective scenes while elevating the thrilling brutality of its combat. this is one of gaming’s most incredible stories made definitive. even the greatest sceptic of its legacy may not be able to resist its charming characters, airtight mechanics and thematic nuance. the last of us part 1 is a beautiful, accessible entry point for newcomers and a victory lap for fans. don’t miss it! when you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.

10,https://www.godisageek.com/reviews/the-last-of-us-part-1-review/,God is a Geek,100," i’ve played through the last of us more than anything else in the thirty plus years i’ve been in love with video games, and there’s a reason for that. from the original released in 2013 to the ps4 remaster that arrived a year later, joel and ellie’s epic tale has been ingrained in my brain to the point i know it very well. once again, now on the newest generation of playstation, naughty dog has remade it from the ground up using the latest technology, and to call it special would be an understatement. the last of us part 1 is the best way to appreciate just how phenomenal the game truly is. it would be easy to call the last of us part 1 an opportunity to make sony some easy money, but seeing just how impressive it is makes it obvious to see why neil druckmann and company made the decision to remake it from the ground up. it’s sequel from 2020 won multiple goty awards (including ours) for a reason. naughty dog harnessed a lot of the technology from it to make the original what it is in this remake to do things that could never have been done, and it feels like a brand new game. from the incredible visuals to its abundance of accessibility features, older fans and new are going to have a blast with it. it was obvious from the very beginning, especially during one of the most famous scenes in the entire game. i don’t want to go too heavy into spoilers in case you are going to be playing for the first time, but it’s necessary to highlight just how impressive the facial animations are. with that being said, if this is your first time playing the the title, i am going to have to mention a very early game spoiler. when joel is holding onto sarah, his daughter, and the soldier pulls the trigger that sends a bullet into her chest, it was always heart-breaking to see the scene quickly unfold into tragedy, but with the acute realism now present, it’s even harder to watch. in sarah’s dying seconds, you can see the pain in her eyes, the life quickly draining from her body. her eyes tell you everything you need to know about the panic she’s feeling and the acknowledging glance at her father that she’s about to die. then, as she takes her final breath, a tear trickles from her eye as her heart stops beating, and the air in her lungs leaves for the final time. it’s the way joel looks at her in these final moments, the way tommy watches on helplessly, and the way this poor girl’s fate is sealed because of an impossible situation that is the catalyst for everything that comes after. these types of moments come throughout the last of us part 1, and every time they hit differently than they ever did before. more detailed facial animations make everything more real, and more painful to watch. naughty dog has always been leaps and bounds above other developers when it comes to conveying emotions through character’s faces, but they’ve gone further in making them look almost lifelike now. the visuals are incredible in the environments, too. as grim and broken as the world around them is, it’s equally breath-taking how the smallest detail is brought to life. i noticed these graphical changes consistently throughout the twelve or so hours playing through it. the way puddles of water rippled under my feet or leaves on the trees moved in the wind. how the light shone through the buildings and reflected off windows, or how cars moved under the weight of my feet after jumping on top of them. then there’s the gruesome details i noticed, such as when blowing off a soldier’s head with a shotgun and seeing how bits of brain and skull stuck to a wall, slowly rolling down like those sticky toys shaped like men that move down a window. the last of us part 1 consistently impressed me by just how good it looks. ai of enemies has also been vastly improved, and even replaying the same sections after death yields different encounters and attempts to clear an area. in one area before meeting sam and his brother, i had to make my way through a hotel, and enemies were moving through the rooms, trying to flank me and communicating with one another in an attempt to take me out. these moments are more organic and refreshing to experience, especially as you’ll end up in multiple gunfights throughout the game. even listening to where they are, or their movements highlighted just how the audio had been improved as well. it’s even more terrifying when a pack of infected run at you unexpectedly, or the sound of a distant clicker can be almost pinpointed to a nearby room. sounds are clearer and do a better job of keeping you on edge. the clarity in not only enemy noises but general environmental noises factor in to making the world around you feel more alive. in the fear-inducing moments or during calmer scenes, audio has been masterfully improved. the technology on the playstation 5 has been utilised in every facet of the last of us part 1. haptic feedback is present continually, through all the different weapons and how they feel when pulling the trigger, the tension felt when using a med-kit, explosions from a nail bomb, the rumbling of a river as it crashes against rocks at the hydroelectric plant where you bump into tommy. it’s yet another way in which naughty dog has harnessed the power of the ps5 to make the remake feel more authentic and immersive, proving this isn’t just some cash grab. tlou part ii featured tons of accessibility features, and there’re even more in the last of us part 1. personally i didn’t use that many, but there’re inclusions for all kinds of disabilities and needs, from audio description for visually impaired players to dialogue playing through the controller accompanied by haptic feedback for those who require hearing assistance. naughty dog wants everyone to experience this masterpiece, and it’s a real credit that so much time and effort has been taken to provide a wide range of options for players of all types. the last of us part 1 is so much more than another re-release. it is a remake in the grandest way, bringing everything that made the original special and improving every single aspect of it. left behind, the dlc that brought ellie’s relationship with riley to our attention has also been included, and it’s just as impressive. visually, the whole package is incredible, standing side by side with the best titles on ps5. various audio improvements and technological enhancements made me fall in love with the game all over again, and i couldn’t help being impressed constantly. the best game on playstation 3 that became the best game on playstation 4, is now, quite possibly, the best game on playstation 5. visuals are incredible facial animations are stunning audio is excellent accessibility features are bountiful the last of us part i is a technological marvel, making naughty dog's classic story of survival better than it has ever been before. the visuals are sublime as is the audio, and all of the other changes make this well worth playing all over again.

11,https://www.inverse.com/gaming/last-of-us-part-i-ps5-review,Inverse,100," i may hold some kind of speedrunning record for the quickest death in the last of us part i. just seconds after taking control of joel, and mere moments after the game’s gutting introductory sequence, i ambled over to a nearby police officer in the hopes of picking up some ambient world-building — as one does. she promptly shoulder-checked me to the ground. rude! naturally, i trotted up to her again to see what would happen. within a split second, she shot me in the head with a machine gun. game over. it’s the first of many reminders that the last of us part i pulls no punches. naughty dog’s post-apocalyptic action game is a meditation on a pandemic, militarized police, and a deeply fractured society. when it first released for the playstation 3 back in 2013, tlou felt like grounded and gritty science fiction. now it feels like a warning that hits all too close to home. that said, it’s impossible to stop wanting to see what fresh hell comes next. it’s no secret that the last of us is an exceptional game. it has snagged literally hundreds of industry awards. and the ps5 remake, out september 2, is the best possible way to play it. the environments are beautiful, the sound design impeccable, the gameplay relentlessly satisfying. but it’s the singular storytelling and characters that elevate the last of us part i to something far greater than yet another “game of the year” contender. nine years, a ps4 remaster, and a ps5 remake later, it’s abundantly clear — video games don’t get much better than this. our story takes place in 2033, twenty years after a mysterious plague has ravaged humanity, transforming those afflicted into vicious fungal monsters known as infected. (the game quite deliberately avoids ever using the term zombie, though they are certainly a form of walking dead.) a gruff, middle-aged survivor named joel crosses paths with a 14-year-old girl named ellie, who just might hold the secret to humanity’s salvation. the unlikely duo journeys across the ruins of the united states to seek out the research lab of the fireflies, a morally dubious — and not particularly successful — resistance organization seeking to overthrow the militarized police who wield absolute power over the nation’s quarantine zones. (yes, like the a-hole lady who shot me.) the last of us broke new ground with its stunning visuals in 2013. and now, the remake is easily one of the best-looking games on playstation 5, with a remarkable level of nuance to its shattered cityscapes and wildly overgrown suburbs. everywhere you look is redolent with detail — the stitching on joel’s jeans, the tatty patches on ellie’s backpack, the abandoned homes spangled with early 2010s electronics. many games aspire to create worlds that feel lived in, and part i achieves that goal with ease, despite the fact that pretty much everyone in this world is dead. formidable good looks are actually one of the least compelling reasons to buy this game, especially if you’ve experienced it before. sony and naughty dog have taken quite a lot of heat for charging $70 for this remake. (for those of us geezerly enough to remember $79 or even $99 price tags for genesis and n64 games during the late ‘90s, it’s a little baffling.) but part i goes far deeper than a mere visual overhaul, and the overall experience is well worth the cost of admission. for one thing, the sound design has been enormously improved, with the ps5’s 3d audio functionality allowing you to hear shambling baddies and sneaky grunts above you, behind you, to one side or the other. i have no idea how any of this technology works, nor do i care to. i do know that it feels like magic and adds enormously to the sense of immersion. if you’ve ever considered picking up one of sony’s pulse 3d headsets, this is the one you want it for. like its sequel, the last of us part i can be a very challenging experience — both in terms of the emotional weight of its story and the daunting combat. both are apt reflections of joel and ellie’s staggeringly violent world, where one clumsy misstep or fumbled molotov can result in a swift and gory demise. but that challenge can also be an accessibility barrier, or just a total fun sponge. prior to the ps5 remake, i’d played the last of us exactly once, and while i enjoyed the heck out of it, i also had a vivid memory of becoming hopelessly stuck on a particular sequence i was not keen to revisit. (it’s the bit where you play as ellie, attempting to escape from a very, very bad man in a burning hotel, and it’s much more fun in the ps5 version.) thankfully, part i integrates almost all of the 60+ accessibility features of part ii, with the exception of a few features that were specific to scenarios from the sequel. these are groundbreaking innovations for players with motor, visual, and auditory differences. they also make the game a more pleasant, customizable experience for literally anyone else. if you’re up for a meaty challenge, you can enable the permadeath function, make crafting resources and ammo scarce, and render infected virtually indestructible. if you’re not, you can make your enemies oblivious and transform joel into an action hero who eats bullets for breakfast. this freedom to customize the experience goes far deeper than difficulty options. you can automatically pick up nearby items, climb onto ledges, and even skip puzzles entirely. a quick tap of the left joystick will show an arrow pointing you in the proper direction to progress the story. you can change these settings at almost any time. (if you’re in the thick of a battle, you may lose a few minutes of progress to start from a recent checkpoint.) by discreetly eliminating frustration on so many fronts, the last of us part i makes it easy to savor its rewarding combat and peerless storytelling. the last of us is a beautifully told tale of awful people doing awful things in awful places. it is consistently thrilling, occasionally uplifting, and often very sad. some people will complain the game feels too linear, a dated series of hallways. frankly, i expected to feel similarly, but instead i came away impressed by the clear intentionality of the level design and pacing. nothing here feels like superfluous bloat. if you explore a little, you will usually be rewarded. and once you’ve caught your breath, you move on to the next arena of terror. two years after its grueling sequel, it is very clear why the team at naughty dog added the part i to the title. though the team has not changed the story or script, revisiting the last of us reveals just how intrinsically bound it is to its successor — there are echoes and rhymes everywhere. i went into this game knowing precisely what was going to happen. but the why and how it all transpires knocked me off my feet, more than it did the first time. when part ii came out in march 2020, joel’s storyline kicked off a massive online debate, most of which was exhausting and gross. as a whole, the last of us pulls off a rather ingenious trick, which you won’t realize until well into its second half — this was never really about joel. ellie has always been the main character of this story. (even if marketing execs didn’t want a girl on the box back in 2013.) and her evolution from a comic-book scavenging smartass into a blood-soaked monster weeping on a beach is one of the most captivating stories ever told in a game. or anywhere else, for that matter. unforgettable characters, sky-high stakes, nail-biting action, and impeccable pacing make the last of us part i a superlative gaming experience in every possible sense. at every turn, it’s obvious that the team at naughty dog has loved, refined, and obsessed over this story for more than a decade. and thanks to a remarkably deep bench of accessibility features, more players can enjoy it now than ever before. will it please everyone? certainly not. nevertheless, the last of us part i easily claims a place among the very best games ever made. the last of us part i comes to ps5 on september 2. the pc version does not yet have a confirmed release date.

12,https://www.theloadout.com/the-last-of-us-remake/part-1-review,The Loadout,100,"naughty dog revisits and remakes one of the greatest games of all time and our the last of us part 1 remake review covers why it is an exemplary remake ten years on, the original the last of us is still regarded as a transformative game. when i first played it, aged 13, it blew me away. i had never played anything so gritty and realistic, with a narrative that was as good as premier tv shows. but after finishing the ps5 remake of the last of us part 1, i have had yet another transformative experience that represents just how far games have come in nine years. while the whole game has seen two generations of visual upgrades, the most striking and also the most subtle is the environmental upgrades all around you. simply put, naughty dog has been able to pack so much more into every single location you visit. i played through the whole game whilst using a video guide for the original game to snap up all the collectibles. and by doing that, i got a one-to-one comparison of every location in the game and consistently found myself stunned at what naughty dog has done on ps5. bill’s town and pittsburg are now far more overgrown with flora wrapping around buildings to a greater degree and covering the ground in vast swathes. what once was just roads with overgrown plants around them, is now an entangled web where the moss, weeds, and grass overlap and interweave with the roads, cars, and buildings creating a dense and vibrant contrast between the old world and the new one. the aesthetic of the environments in the game better aligns with the last of us part 2 and features a more green and natural tone than the orange and brown that was plastered all over the original game, almost like a filter. indoor environments like the pittsburgh checkpoint have been significantly upgraded. what once was a wooden wall behind a cafe sign in this location now has an inscribed picture printed onto it, giving the environment a more realistic look like people used the space before society fell. walls, shopfronts, building interiors, and practically any other environment you can think of have seen a huge visual enhancement, with the materials and textures of them better reflecting the real world. colours pop as you explore the mall in left behind and darkness dims sections of the sewers and hotel basement giving them a whole new atmosphere. looking back you can see just how much the technology restricted what naughty dog could do and as i revisited location after location i was captivated by just how different the various sections of the game are in this remake. this all gives the last of us part 1 a refreshing sense of immersion and a heightened post-apocalyptic feel that, while it might be cliche to say, really makes it feel like a brand-new game. the core of my love for the original game came from the story and the survival third-person action gameplay. while the setting was haunting because of the clickers, you never really felt scared at what might be around the corner or the sounds you heard in the distance. but, that extra realism added with this remake adds a whole new dimension to experiencing the last of us, even if you have already played it before. the 3d audio really amplifies that as well, as it allows you to hear enemies screech well before you see them, and the feeling of being ambushed by stalkers who are behind you or lurking in the shadows is blood-curdling. similarly, joel’s desperation, reflected in the dualsense controller during an intense brawl with multiple enemies, adds an extra kick to the feeling of intense survival that runs right through the last of us. this is done through the click of a shotgun as you panic pump the barrel or reload, the subtle breaths of joel struggling as he fights, or the rumble of the controller as you and your enemy are thrown around as you trade blows. smaller details like the rumble of the dualsense when the armoured truck rolls by and shakes the ground or the light trigger pulls and resistance differentiating each weapon give the whole game a greater sense of reflecting the real world. objects feel physical, weighty, and look like they do in the real world. systems like the new workbench and revamped collectible menu, which are ported over from the last of us part 2 give you that close-up of items in the world and help remove the idea that the pistol is a videogame gun or the document is just a collectible. additional improvements to the enemy ai also modernise the gameplay experience of joel and ellie’s adventure across the united states. enemies are now far smarter and more sophisticated. this leads to the game no longer feeling like a shooting gallery at times, as you take down enemies one by one with genuine stealth to progress to the next area. humans will double back, hone in on your position, look around desperately if one of them stumbles upon a dead friend, and generally surprise you by diverting off paths that were set in stone in the original release. in a lot of ways the game plays like the last of us part 2, but you still retain that more restricted, bulky feeling as joel, which offers a different flavour to ellie’s heightened manoeuvrability. these improvements, the general upgrades to the facial animations when runners or humans are shot, as well as the improved visuals during cinematics, all help to bring the last of us part 1 into the modern day while you are playing. the core experience and everything that made the last of us part 1 great remains untouched, with some fun extra modes and unlockables for you to earn. but, after playing the last of us part 1 and seeing the upgrades and enhancements in action i can see why it was remade. everything here from the gameplay improvements with the dualsense and ai to the completely overhauled environments all amplifies the emotions, feelings, and themes naughty dog was trying to convey with the original game in 2013. it’s rare a remake feels truly transformational for a game, let alone a game that is less than ten years old, but the last of us part 1 is the exception. these changes all make the game feel less like you are playing through levels and instead like going on a journey or reading a book from cover to cover. and while joel and ellie take you along for the ride in this remake, you’ll also get to experience your own little journey too – and that one illustrates just how far games have come in such little time. the last of us part 1 is a truly stunning remake that significantly heightens the immersion of one of the best games ever made with denser environments, more realistic gameplay, and beautiful remastered visuals.

13,https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/the-last-of-us-part-1/,VGC,100,"for those who can stomach the $70 asking price, naughty dog’s stunning remake is a triumph there’s a notable difference in the way that video game and movie fans discuss home releases. while releasing the same film a multitude of times on vhs, then dvd, then hddvd, then blu-ray and then uhd blu-ray is an accepted practice, in games, the sheer idea of releasing the last of us for the third time in under a decade has generated a level of anger and dismissal that seems strange for what is one of the most critically beloved games ever. there are legitimate holes one could poke in the idea of the last of us part 1. for one, the price is a lot for any game, no less one that you probably own in some form. it’s also worth noting that it’s arguably a lesser package than the ps3 or ps4 versions as it’s missing multiplayer (although a last of us multiplayer project is currently in development). but it’s in the third camp that we find our biggest difference of opinion. the idea that it’s a “pointless” remake and that it’s “barely different” to the playstation 4 version. the last of us part 1 isn’t a pointless remake. the last of us part 1 is an essential remake that uses the sheer power at its disposal to make the best elements of the game even better. there’s a scene around fifteen minutes into the story (and if you’ve played the game, you know what we’re talking about) that was a perfect case study for why the game should exist. while that scene was moving on the ps3 and ps4, and really set the tone for the powerful emotional heartstrings that were yet to be tugged throughout, on ps5, it’s practically unwatchable. not only is the sequence itself horrific, but the reactions from joel and tommy are so heightened, so much more impactful, and so realistic, that it feels like a milestone moment for performance capture in games, just like it was the first time. some will want to skip this scene. others will find themselves turning away or fighting the lump in their throat. this is all thanks to the incredible strides the game has made visually. at times, the difference between the ps4 and ps5 versions of the game feels akin to bluepoint’s demon’s souls. and it’s not in the sweeping city or the worn-down interiors, which look fantastic, but it’s in the characters. naughty dog has been afforded so much more room to wordlessly convey the game’s narrative, and form relationships, that we feel like we’re catching new threads of a game that we’ve played half a dozen times over the decade. the final narrative beat in the last of us asks the players to question whether or not ellie believes joel. and while that was wonderfully handled in the original, and was a landmark for subtle storytelling in games, the last of us part 1 is full of those moments. “at times, the difference between the ps4 and ps5 versions of the game feels akin to bluepoint’s demon’s souls. and it’s not in the sweeping city or the worn-down interiors, which look fantastic, but it’s in the characters.” when it comes to gameplay, the last of us part 1 lacks the improvements that so improved the combat of the stellar second game, but as the encounters are far more limited in part 1, it still works perfectly well. you’ll ideally avoid resorting to firepower, especially on the harder difficulty settings, and with stunning hdr and lighting effects, those quiet crawls past clickers in subway stations are just as terrifying as they’ve always been. the game offers two modes, a fidelity option that targets 40 fps and offers all of the visual bells and whistles that you’d expect from a modern ps5 game trying to push graphics to the limit. we found that this was a fairly consistent way to play the game, apart from the way instances where the player’s flashlight interacts with water in dark areas. the cascading lighting and shadows are spectacular, but the frame rate takes a brief respite from the action to accommodate the lighting wizardly. the performance mode is rock solid, and for those with the screens to display it, there’s even a 120 fps mode as well. it is clearly very easy to look at this product from the outside and say, “it’s just graphics”, and if you’re looking for an itemised list of what is new in the game, then fine, but it misses the context of why significant graphical improvements on the last of us would be so important. the thing that made the last of us such a significant game was the galactic leaps it made in performance capture and storytelling on the ps3 in its dying days. this version of the game finally feels like it’s conveying the game’s most sublime storytelling moments in the way it was always meant to, but technologically couldn’t. there isn’t a developer working today that can deliver these experiences with quite the utter mastery that naughty dog displays. $70 is a steep mountain to climb. while the lack of multiplayer is a shame, as the original mode was highly underrated, naughty dog clearly has multiplayer aspirations that would far outshine remaking the game’s original suite. but, if you want to play the very best version of one of the greatest games that has ever been made, then the last of us part 1 is a triumph. not everyone needs to buy that uhd bluray. but there are some people that want that. and in this case, it not only makes the entire experience look generationally better than its last iteration, but it also makes an already stellar story, and unmatched performances even better. $70 is a steep mountain to climb. but, if you want to play the very best version of one of the greatest games that has ever been made, then the last of us part 1 is a triumph. no part of this

15,https://egmnow.com/the-last-of-us-part-i-review/,EGM,100,"i’m going to make this very simple: the last of us part i presents the best version of joel and ellie’s story that you can play. if you’ve never experienced it before and you want to see what all the fuss is about, this is the version you should get. it should be pretty obvious as to why this is the case. the game looks better. it sounds better. the animation is better. the gameplay is better (though not as improved as those first three areas). you can just look at the side-by-side comparisons that playstation has published and tell that this is the case. i almost feel like i didn’t need to play the game to come to that conclusion. but after playing through the entirety of joel and ellie’s story once again, and after playing some of left behind for the first time, i feel like the marketing materials and trailers don’t do it justice. visually, the last of us part i looks absolutely stunning, especially in the game’s fidelity mode, which presents it in true 4k with raytracing at the cost of only running at 30 frames per second. if given the choice, i generally prefer to play games in their respective performance modes, but the slower frame rate didn’t bother me as much as i expected here. (the game also offers the ability to unlock the framerate on performance mode, but because i was playing on a 60hz display, i wasn’t able to take advantage of that option.) the textures in fidelity mode didn’t look that much better than they did in performance mode, but the higher resolution and the lighting made a huge difference. naughty dog has traded a more dramatic, high-contrast lighting model for something more realistic, yet i never felt like they were sacrificing anything in terms of narrative or tone. the last of us’ story is as dire as it ever was, but the more believable lighting and more detailed models presented a clearer picture of a post-collapse world. now, to be clear, i’m not someone who has a nostalgic connection to how the last of us used to look, whether in its original or remastered forms. i first played the last of us remastered years after it launched in preparation for part ii; i enjoyed it so much that i played through the campaign twice, but even then, i already felt like the game looked pretty dated. after playing part ii, this was even more obvious. maybe this is looking too much into it, but it’s almost like the original the last of us and the last of us remastered look how players would imagine a scary, post-apocalyptic world to look, whereas part i looks more like how that world would look to someone like joel, who spent the last 20 years acclimating to collapse, or to ellie, who’s never known any other world. sure, it’s overgrown and dingy, with death creeping around every corner, but it can also be beautiful or even mundane. it just looks more real. but even more than the lighting, the textures, and the resolution, the aspect of the visuals that makes the biggest difference in part i is the animation. it’s hard to put into words how much more believable and effective the performances are here, but i’m going to try: it’s as if the actors were previously wearing masks of their own faces in the older games, and now they have removed those masks. all of the subtle facial tics, all of the precise decisions the actors made, every single emotion is now visible on the faces of the characters, and i can’t overstate just how much more effective that makes the performances. like i said, i never wore nostalgia goggles when it came to the last of us. as much as i enjoyed the story, i don’t think i ever connected to it on a deeper emotional level the way that people who originally fell in love with the game in 2013 did. things were very different this time around. despite knowing everything that happened, i still felt that emotional rush, especially during the game’s bombastic, tragic opening. suddenly, joel’s journey from selfish survivor to selfish father figure made sense. that later moment in the house, when ellie is about to leave with tommy and joel finally has to make a decision about his own humanity, felt so much deeper and more earned. the last of us has always been about the fact that people have a choice, whether they will admit it or not, but that finally clicked with me after playing through part i. as for gameplay improvements, those were slightly more subtle. crafting definitely feels more intuitive, as it more closely resembled part ii’s system, and moving around the world is slightly smoother and more natural. structurally, however, part i definitely feels like an older game, especially in the shadow of its sequel. the latter’s more intricate level design makes part i’s come off as a little too straightforward and obvious. enemy behavior is likewise a little too simplistic; human foes still do the video game thing of seeing a dead body and then slowly walking towards it, without even considering the possibility that the person who murdered their friend is simply waiting behind a waist-high wall for them to walk past. that’s not to say that part i’s gameplay is bad; just don’t expect naughty dog to have copy-and-pasted part ii’s improved combat. where the last of us part i doesn’t feel dated is in its various accessibility options and modes. the second game became the standard for making sure that as many people as possible could experience it, and part i takes that just a little bit further. all of the same options are there, but now you can even fine-tune things like enemy behavior without having to knock down the difficulty level entirely. the different contrast options are there, as are audio descriptions of the cutscenes. i’m by no means qualified to judge how accessible a game is for everyone, but i can say that naughty dog has at least exceeded the already robust suite of options that was present in the last game. there’s also a surprising amount of replayability. there are several options for permadeath, as well as a new speedrun mode, for those willing to put their skills to the test. if you want a new experience without making your life more difficult, there are a ton of mods you can unlock that have various effects on the game. there’s a mirror mod which flips the game world on its horizontal axis, mods that turn your melee or projectile attacks (or both) into one-hit kills, a ton of audio options like one that makes it sound as if the characters are constantly inhaling helium, and more. that’s not to mention that part i includes both the main game as well as the left behind dlc, which shows ellie’s life before she meets the fireflies and joel. sure, it’s unfortunate that we didn’t get an updated version of factions, but considering naughty dog is hard at work on its standalone last of us multiplayer game, that’s not too surprising. if you’ve read this entire review and still think that the last of us part i isn’t worth playing, then there’s probably nothing else i can say to convince you, and hey, fair enough. this is, after all, the third time naughty dog has released this story, and for a lot of people it will be the third time (or more) that they will have played it. but, as far as i’m concerned, after playing through joel and ellie’s story yet again, this is the definitive version of the last of us, and well worth revisiting. sure, this might be the third time that naughty dog has released the last of us, but it’s also the most fully realized version. the enhanced visuals and animation bring joel and ellie’s story to life in a way that was previously unimaginable, and the gameplay still holds up, despite not totally catching up to part ii. whether or not you want to pay to play the same story for a third time is up to you, but that won’t change the fact that it’s better than it’s ever been.

16,https://www.gameshub.com/news/reviews/the-last-of-us-part-1-remake-ps5-review-vivid-memories-clear-as-day-28170/,GamesHub,100," it feels a little strange for me to be going through the last of us part 1. the last of us is a game i have played through several times in its original playstation 3 iteration, and several times in its remastered iteration for playstation 4, most recently in 2020 as a refresher course that immediately preceded my time through the last of us part ii. needless to say, the last of us is a game that resonates with me. but playing through part i has got me thinking about what exactly is so special about this game. playing through the original story now, with the knowledge of everything that happens to these characters in part ii, is a weird, emotional experience. it feels like looking back on an old photo album of times long gone. reliving memories of people and places that are no longer with you. the only thing is, those memories aren’t fuzzy or seen through rose-tinted lenses. they’re clear as day – in fact, more vibrant and detailed than they were to begin with. which somehow makes revisiting them all the more heartbreaking. it feels silly to be saying this about completely fictional beings – but these characters made a big impression on me. the last of us part 1 is a new edition of the beloved game for playstation 5 (and eventually, pc) that sees stone-cold survivor joel tasked with transporting lively tween girl ellie across a post-apocalyptic united states, as the two endure and survive the environment, work through their trauma together, and forge an incredibly powerful bond throughout the journey. also included within part i is left behind, the very memorable side story that focuses on the nuanced relationship between ellie and her close friend, riley. part i completely rebuilds the models and environments of the 10-year-old game from the ground up, with developer naughty dog using current rendering technology – presumably developed through the studio’s interim titles, and far more advanced than what was originally used. the game looks to make the absolute most of the ps5’s technological capabilities, in the same way that the original release made the most of the ps3’s capabilities at the end of its life cycle. the natural question: is the last of us part 1 the same game? essentially, yes. the new versions of the last of us and its excellent side story, left behind, remain virtually identical in structure and narrative. small improvements have been made to the combat system, but it retains the same desperate, hefty, and savage feel. it’s a very faithful translation. the next natural question: does the overhaul affect the experience in any meaningful way? well, kind of. a lot of the time, it can be difficult to tell what’s changed and what hasn’t in part i without the benefit of a direct side-by-side comparison – even as someone who has played through the game multiple times, and considers themselves very sensitive to the nitty-gritty of computer graphics and video resolutions. ‘this is how it always was, more or less,’ i’d say to myself, unassuredly. other times, the decade of technical progress is incredibly pronounced, especially during the game’s cutscenes. during the emotional prologue – which still hits just as hard – tears will stream convincingly, flesh is malleable. in the game’s more heated moments, spittle will fly as characters yell with ferocity. sweat lingers on the skin. eyes are that much closer to being lifelike. it all helps to further sell the impact of moments both quiet and tense. certain environments are noticeably lusher with foliage – the original game was largely brown and grey – and others are certainly more atmospheric with impressive, naturalistic lighting. overall, the game appears to have been regraded, recoloured, and rebuilt to make better use of a more varied palette, and a greater capacity for world objects. but the biggest question is: in another 10 years, will any of these new improvements stand out as defining things i’ll remember about the last of us? no, they won’t. what will continue to stick with me are the performances of troy baker and ashley johnson as joel and ellie. it’s the heartbreaking stories and quiet character moments, especially in left behind. it’s those last few lines at the end of the game that land heavy and haunt you with uncertainty. everything that i will continue to remember has existed since 2013. the extra sweat, spit and tears make those moments more visceral, but the heart of the game was already there. when i do inevitably decide to revisit the last of us once more in the future, i’ll be pleased that the last of us part 1 exists, though. aside from the visual overhaul to modernise it for modern systems and screens, the additional improvements to smooth out the experience are welcome. seemingly improved behaviour for enemies and your companions is exciting – being cleverly flanked from behind is not something i recall in the original, and ellie no longer foolishly runs full-pelt in plain sight of the enemies during stealth sections – something that amusingly sticks out in the original and remaster. it’s difficult to fault the existence of part i especially considering the staggering wealth of new accessibility options, first introduced in the last of us part ii, and expanded on in part i. the video game-enjoying audience has grown greatly in the past decade, and being able to cater to a larger variety of new players at various levels of ability is worthwhile. though i don’t typically identify as someone who requires accessibility features, i still found many of the new options very helpful – using the high contrast visual mode to assist in my obsessive desire for collectables, for one, as well as the persistent crosshair option to help stave off occasional bouts of motion sickness. voiced audio descriptions for the action on screen, as well as the controller rumble mimicking the cadence of speech, also feel like very strong additions to the comprehensive suite. i don’t like to make assumptions about you as a reader, and your circumstances when you come to play a game, but when talking about a unique project like this, it’s hard not to think about the various audiences who will approach part i. if you’ve played the last of us before, you know what you’re in for, and whether it will resonate with you or not. if you haven’t, it’s an easy recommendation – it’s a landmark cinematic action game that has aged well ten years on, and is worth trying, no matter which version you play. the last of us part 1 doesn’t create any lasting memories about the experience that weren’t already there from the beginning. for that reason, my thoughts about the game’s existence as a product remain dubious. but as a creative work in and of itself, the last of us is still exceptional, and i’m happy to have had reason to experience it again, in a new context and an updated format. regardless of why part i exists, when i decide to return to the story of joel, ellie, riley, and the rest once more, i’ll be glad to know that it’ll most likely be as good – perhaps slightly better – as i remember. edmond is the managing editor of gameshub. he was previously at gamespot for 13 years, where he was the australian editor and an award-winning video producer. you can follow him @edmondtran signalis modernises traditional survival horror ideas, and crafts a pleasingly mysterious and aesthetic journey. mario + rabbids sparks of hope is a rare sequel that eclipses its predecessor, carving out a unique identity in… gotham knights is determined to escape the shadows of the arkham series – but lives up to its legacy regardless. new tales from the borderlands is an intimate and surprising spin on the classic tales formula. a cinematic narrative adventure with a strong identity, stunning set pieces, and lots and lots of rats. receive newsletters featuring leading industry job, news, opportunities and events we acknowledge aboriginal and torres strait islanders as the traditional owners of the land on which we produce artshub, screenhub and gameshub. we pay our respects to elders, past, present and emerging. sovereignty has never been ceded. copyright (c) 2022 artshub, screenhub & gameshub. all rights reserved.

17,https://www.gamespew.com/2022/08/the-last-of-us-part-i-review/,GameSpew,100,"in this case, the cake is the last of us. originally released on ps3 in 2013 before being remastered for ps4 a year later, it still holds up well to this day. but after the phenomenal the last of us part ii, naughty dog has revisited its masterpiece once more, bringing it into line with its improved sequel. some might say it’s a little unnecessary, but why wouldn’t you want to play one of the best games of all time with enhanced gameplay, reworked visuals and a wealth of new features? first, a recap for those who are somehow not familiar with the hit game. set to be a blockbuster hbo show early next year, the last of us focuses on rough-and-ready survivor joel, and a young girl he’s been tasked to smuggle who could be the key to saving mankind. in a post-apocalyptic future where a fungal infection turns people into violent monsters, however, their journey is an arduous one. and monsters aren’t the only hostiles they’ll meet. back when it launched in 2013, the last of us was a revelation. its story was – and still is – one of the greatest ever told in a video game, full of drama, trauma, horror and emotional beats that are rarely seen in the medium. it looked mighty fine for a ps3 game, too, and those visuals were pushed even further on ps4. even now, you can load it up on ps5 and be somewhat impressed. but the last of us part i, specifically made for ps5, clearly looks a generation ahead. the screenshots on this page and what you’ve likely seen posted on forums simply do not do this remake justice. naughty dog has truly raised the bar here, bringing the world of the last of us to life like never before. character models are eerily lifelike, with facial animations that are simply obscene. and environments are absolutely packed with detail, truly giving the sense of a lived-in world that has gone to ruin. throw in additional effects like enhanced lighting and realistic reflections, and you have what is quite possibly the best-looking game available right now. steps have been taken to make you feel more grounded in the world of the last of us, too. little things like dishwasher doors closing as you push yourself up against them when in cover, and cars wobbling as they come under enemy fire may not seem that impactful, but they further add to the immersion. go back to the last of us remastered, and everything seems sterile and fake in comparison, like the entire world is just make out of one big slab of rock. here, even your enemies are more believable as bags of flesh, with your attacks now taking them apart in grisly detail. but it’s not all just about the visuals: gameplay has undergone some improvements as well. for a start, the last of us part i simply feels a little nicer to play. it flows better, with you now able to do things like throw objects while moving. what’s more important, though, is how your enemies have been upgraded. they now have a wealth of new animations, making them much more lifelike. shoot the leg of a hunter, for example, and they’ll crumple to the floor in agony, giving you a chance to either follow up your attack or escape. their a.i. has also been dramatically improved. your enemies are cleverer, more effectively making use of cover and keeping you on your toes as they work together to try and flank you. and don’t worry, your companions have had a common sense upgrade too: they’ll no longer run around like headless chickens during moments of tense combat and stealth. the result is a game that feels much more natural, and challenging if you want it to be. which leads us to the next aspect of the last of us that has been given some attention in this remake. like the last of us part ii, your experience here is largely customisable. while all the standard difficulty presets remain, you can also create your own custom difficulty if you wish, tweaking everything from enemy aggressiveness to scarcity of ammo. complete the last of us part i once, and you can even unlock a range of game modifiers, creating fun new ways to play. that’s just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to extras. new permadeath and speedrun modes have also been added, which will no doubt excite some players, and there’s a model viewer so you can inspect character assets in all their glorious detail. the developer commentary from the remastered version of the game makes a return as well, allowing you to play while gaining an insight into what went into creating the game during cutscenes. the biggest winners here, though, are those who couldn’t enjoy the last of us before due to its poor accessibility options. the last of us part i has pretty much all of the wonderful accessibility options found in the last of us part ii, as well as some new ones. take for example the dualsense controller. here it’s used to further immerse you in the action, offering resistance when you use guns, for example, and giving feedback when you’re hit by drops of rain. but it can also be used to offer feedback for dialogue, effectively portraying the emotion of a scene. of course, there are some disappointments. while the gameplay of the last of us part i now is aligned much more closer with its sequel, it’s a shame that you can’t go prone or dodge enemy attacks. but the reasons why they’re likely not here are somewhat understandable. being able to go prone would require a full rework of the game’s environments, which just isn’t in this remake’s remit. and besides, we see joel as a more direct kind of guy. the gameplay improvements that are here are enough to make it feel modern. with this remake, naughty dog has made one of the best games of all time even better. while you may look at screenshots or snippets of video footage and think that it looks and plays just like you remember it, go back to an older version and you’ll realise just how much work has been done here. yes, the last of us remastered still holds up well, and you can stick with it if you like, but for newcomers and ardent fans the last of us part i is a treat that’s worth every penny. it would be one thing if this emotional rollercoaster was just as captivating now as it was nine years ago. but in fact, it’s even more so. and that’s an impressive achievement.

playstation 5 that is not only beautiful to play but filled with emotion. about: experience the emotional storytelling and unforgettable characters in the last of us, winner of over 200 game of the year awards. in a ravaged civilization, where infected and hardened survivors run rampant, joel, a weary protagonist, is hired to smuggle 14-year-old ellie out of a military quarantine zone. however, what starts as a small job soon transforms into a brutal cross-country journey. includes the complete the last of us single-player story and celebrated prequel chapter, left behind, which explores the events that changed the lives of ellie and her best friend riley forever. the last of us part i ps5 review: just over 9-years ago, one of the most impressive games on the playstation 3 was released with naughty dog’s spectacular gaming narrative, the last of us which literally took the gaming world by storm. it had everything that made a game great, an amazing story set in a post apocalyptic world, compelling characters with joel and ellie, engaging gameplay and graphics that pushed this console to the max. for many (including myself), it became one of my favourite games of all time. a year later, it received a ps4 remastered edition that was again enhanced for the playstation 4 pro that took the graphics to a whole new level, including improved and smoother gameplay due to the architecture of this console. june 2020 saw the highly anticipated sequel, the last of us part ii that would conclude this amazing and heartfelt story as we would say our final goodbyes to ellie and joel. needless to say, it was a journey for us gamers as these characters becomes part of our gaming lives. not so fast said naughty dog who redeliver this game onto the playstation 5 that like the original ps3 version, the remastered version on the ps4 and the sequel, it takes us back to where it all started, however with all the fine trimmings of this powerful next-gen console! but is this is a remaster or a remake? according to art director shaun escayg from naughty dog, he puts this question to rest… to me, what makes this a remake instead of a remaster is the sum of its improvements. this isn’t just the same characters, environments, art direction, etc., performing on better hardware. we completely redesigned everything from the art direction, lighting, [lighting] technology to the character designs themselves. we’ve applied everything we’ve learned over the decade since the original and utilized that new technology to create something that stays true to the original but reimagined in an updated way. screw the naysayers who think that the last of us part i is just a cash grab and while it has strong parallels to the original game, naughty dog have rebuilt the game from the ground up to take full advantage of the architecture of the playstation 5 and their new engine from its graphical capabilities, next-gen gaming mechanics (including haptics) and exceptional 3d audio. if you have played the game before, the first thing that you will notice are the vastly improved visuals and i mean vastly improved, followed by the smoother gameplay that for me, makes it feel like a whole new game as i revisit this amazing and dangerous world again. it’s like being part of your very own hollywood post apocalyptic blockbuster. compared to the ps4 pro version, the last of us part 1 on the playstation 5 is stunning. the background environments are outstanding, particularly the attention to detail which makes the world a very interactive one. additionally, the lighting is realistic as are the reflective surfaces and water effects with the later giving raytracing a run for its money. characters move with an uncanny realism and the textures on the characters scream next-gen mechanics, including great facial features which portray real emotion. the scene where joel loses his daughter as the world turns to crap made me tear up, due to the realistic graphics plus clever use of haptics. this in-game cinemas are almost like prerendered ones. further, naughty dog are not just game developers, rather, they strongly focus on the narrative and whether this is the first time you played the game, second, third or fourth… it’s a very engaging experience from start to finish. another bonus of this release is that it includes the prequel (sort of) chapter left behind which revolves around ellie and her best friend riley which further explores this amazing video game character… joel is also there. adding to the ps5 version is a new “speedrun mode” that tracks your play time and then compares it to previous playthroughs. this is just one of many tweaks on the ps5 version of this game. while most playstation fans know the story behind the lats of us part 1, here is a recap and a snapshot for newcomers. joel has been given the task of protecting ellie, a young girl who may save the future of humanity due to her immunity from the spores that has decimated the world and turned humans into zombie-like creatures. as you travel across america, you will meet dangerous survivors, a clandestine military and humans controlled by this parasitic plant organism that really up the ante in terms of action. seeing and hearing the clickers and stalkers again really sent a shiver up my spine, especially with the limited weaponry. with that said, ammunition is scarce and sometimes stealth is the only way to solve certain areas in the game. as the game is in third person, it does give the player some great dynamics on how they view the world and naughty dog should be complimented on such sturdy gaming mechanics which really complement the ps5 architecture and stunning graphics. i also love the implementation of haptics and whether its firing an arrow, shooting a gun or just interacting with the environment, it adds an additional layer gaming of immersion. combat also feels very different and more importantly… random. as a result, ai is more realistic as their searching, attacks and combat is unpredictable. this is a big change compared to the original which was scripted in its approach. given that, both the humans and freaky stalkers can be quite a challenge, especially if you are not stealthy in your approach as they literally hunt you down. this makes it quite satisfying when you take out your enemies though. if you are a little green to gaming, there is an option for auto-aim and even a slow motion choice to help you get those precise attacks completed. exploring the environment is still similar, however the controls and way your characters interact is a considerably smoother experience which again is where this remake shines. puzzles still work well with the improved gameplay, including co-op solves with your npc and if too much of a challenge, these can be skipped so you can focus more on the story. in essence it’s the same game but the next-gen remake elements brings this game successfully to 2022. the last of us part 1 on the ps5 was a joy to revisit and while not a new game, it feels familiar yet different and the highlight for me were the amazing visuals on this next-gen console, including the wonderful 3d audio, including the soundtrack and spectacular voice acting. the haptics also add something new and unique. in the end this is a true interactive movie that both fans and newcomers will enjoy as we follow the story of joel and ellie (for some again) as they explore this decimated world that is now brimming with even more emotion. again, gaming doesn’t get any better than this, especially if you have never played it before.

23,https://www.playstationcountry.com/the-last-of-us-part-1-ps5-review/,PlayStation Country,90,"we’re nearly two years into the playstation 5’s lifespan now and it’s pretty well established that remakes and remasters are very much an integral part of playstation’s ecosystem. this year alone we’ve seen uncharted 4: a thief’s end and uncharted: the lost legacy receive shiny next gen updates courtesy of uncharted: legacy of thieves collection, and following ghost of tsushima’s director’s cut last year, it seems that naughty dog weren’t content with leaving arguably their most successful ip in the dust either. it makes sense – these are great games with huge fan bases and all demand repeat playthroughs. certainly in ghost of tsushima’s case, any title that releases close to the end of a console’s lifespan is inevitably going to make some technical compromises for an end-of-gen version that would be worth exploring further on next-gen hardware. in the case of the last of us part ii, which landed in june 2020 – just months away from the playstation 5’s launch, it felt like the playstation 4 was reaching its technical peak. it’s still remarkable that the hardware was able to pull off an action epic of that scope and it naturally got players thinking about what its successor would be capable of when handling the same material. while the last of us part i doesn’t quite answer that question, it’s nevertheless an impressive showcase of how naughty dog’s presentation and ideas translate to the current generation of hardware. it’s been less than a decade since tlou first hit the playstation 3 in 2013, and just eight years since the much-lauded the last of us remastered hit the playstation 4. during that time tlou has warranted countless playthroughs, with its stark depiction of a future america in ruins, and remains a benchmark for storytelling of this kind. in turn, the last of us part i feels like something of a definitive version, reinventing the game entirely from the ground up. neatly implementing some of the sequel’s best stylistic choices and gameplay elements, it retains the heart and soul of joel and ellie’s adventure, whilst sprucing up the original game’s visuals to a remarkable standard. engaging visual touches from the sequel, such as the weapon upgrade sequences, are also now present, which helps add an additional level of immersion otherwise missing in the original game. meanwhile, enhanced lighting and textures make several key moments pop even more this time around. the hotel basement sequence, for example, remains one of the ultimate heart-in-mouth horror moments in any video game. that’s not to say it’s without its flaws, of course. while the cover-based shooting, stealth gameplay and ui have all been sympathetically re-tooled to reflect the sequel, certain segments still lack the wow factor. swimming sections in which joel must carry ellie across water on an improvised raft still feel like an unwelcome interruption to the game’s narrative flow, while navigational setpieces in which the player is required to improvise bridges and ladders feel like impositions, rather than enjoyable puzzles to be solved. that said, these moments are few and far between and feel more like gameplay relics of the playstation 3 era, as opposed to poor contemporary decisions. where the last of us part i really impresses, however, is the integration of the accessibility features that made part ii so impressive. naughty dog have made accessibility a key focus for many years now and the remake takes virtually every possible player need into consideration. multiple options are present for players affecting everything from ui, the option to skip puzzles entirely and enhanced listening functions that assist both visually impaired players and those who just happen to be hardened completists alike. while we wouldn’t be entirely surprised to see the last of us re-tooled again in a decade’s time, it’s difficult to see how naughty dog could have refined the experience further. this very much feels like the definitive statement on a game that has rightly gone on to define an entire generation of action games and one that remains an absolutely essential experience for anyone with even a passing interest in the genre.

part 1 is still the best way to enjoy one of the most intelligent and well designed games of recent memory. the updated visuals helps to breathe new life into the story, and the world it presents has never felt more immersive. and that’s before considering the plethora of accessibility features on hand, enabling swathes of gamers to play the game for the first time and see what all the fuss is about. naughty dog revisits its iconic post-apocalyptic survival shooter, this time rebuilt for the ps5 and stylised as the last of us part 1. when the credits rolled on 2020’s the last of us part 2, i felt so engrossed in the world that naughty dog had created and its brutal tale of revenge that i wasn’t quite ready to say goodbye to it all. i booted up my copy of the last of us: remastered but the technological leap between the two games was too much to ignore and my enthusiasm for replaying the series’ first entry quickly faded away. someone at naughty dog either hacked my brain or had the same feeling themselves because the the last of us part 1 is the same great game that we all know and love, but redesigned with the part 2 toolset. with a £70/$70 price tag at launch, the game has already been criticised for not offering enough incentive for returning players, but is this really the case? here are my thoughts. if you’ve seen a trailer for the last of us part 1 or caught some of its marketing campaign, then you’ll already know that the game’s biggest upgrade over the original is in its graphics. following the visual prowess of the last of us part 2, the part 1 remake is a drop dead gorgeous game to look at, and the newer style adds far more than a lick of paint to an almost decade old title. for starters, the level of detail that can be found when walking through the game’s vision of a post-apocalyptic united states is truly something to behold. the last of us already did a fantastic job of creating a believable world in its level design, with abandoned homes containing traces of the families who lived there, and sprawling cityscapes that have now been reclaimed by nature. but this time around, it feels as if the developers have been able to fully deliver on those concepts in a way that technology simply couldn’t 10 years ago. the various knick knacks that you might expect to find in a family home have been given more attention, and at various times i found myself distracted by dusty family photos that told a story of their own for a group of off-screen characters. there’s so much depth in the details of part 1 that you easily spend several hours of your playthrough just admiring the efforts of the art department. because all of this is now running on the ps5’s heavy-duty hardware, lighting effects have also been given an uplift and they go a long way towards showing what sony’s latest console is capable of. for example, i don’t recall ever being quite so enamoured with bill’s hideout early into the game, but the way the light seeps through the church’s windows forced me to stop in my tracks and appreciate the scene. beyond the in-game visuals, naughty dog has also been keen to note the upgrades that have been made to the character models, which in turn can be most keenly felt during cutscenes. i’ll admit that when i saw the first few comparison trailers, i struggled to see the immediate difference – a problem that likely stems from just how well those cutscenes were originally animated on the ps3. but when you start playing the ps5 adaption, the scale of these improvements are made more apparent. for example, tess has been given a new, more age-appropriate look that better reflects her lived experiences. and when paired with the added detail of joel’s middle-aged appearance, their conversations felt more believable, doing justice to the original motion capture and voice acting, and really driving home the emotion of each scene. if you want to get even more out of the graphics, then the game offers you a choice from the outset, with the ability to play in either ‘performance’ or ‘fidelity’ mode. the former runs at a targeted 60fps while the latter prioritises the visual prowess of the game and is capped at 30fps. there’s definitely a noticeable difference to be found in these two modes, and you can change between them at any time so you don’t have to worry about being locked in. for my my playthrough, i stayed with ‘performance’ mode almost exclusively. after all, one of the best upgrades of 2014’s the last of us remastered was the ability to play in the enhanced frame rate, lending itself brilliantly to the chaotic nature of the game’s shootouts. i also noticed an impressive bit of tinkering with the game’s audio quality, as sounds feel more layered than ever and dialogue comes through more clearly and defined than before. there’s even support for 3d audio, which makes a gunfight with the game’s infected enemies even more adrenaline inducing. it should be mentioned that i encountered barely any visual or audio hiccups during my time with the game which is a rare thing to see these days. this is about as polished a aaa game could be at launch. it’s almost impossible to have a conversation about the last of us without circling back to the game’s story. the game made waves upon release for its bleak depiction of what humanity would do to survive if civilisation fell apart. very few games have come close to the storytelling heights of the last of us, and in a post-pandemic world, the many references to quarantines, testing and face coverings suddenly don’t seem quite so abstract. but i think it’s fair to assume, given that part 1 constitutes the second re-release of the title, that many gamers will be wondering if it’s worth playing through again. i would argue emphatically that it is. as previously mentioned, the updated character models give the game’s narrative aspects more depth as the characters themselves are better realised. then again, i’m speaking as someone who hasn’t revisited the game in roughly eight years, so it’s been an exciting experience to remember why i enjoyed it so much in the first place. if you’ve played it more recently then this is where things get a bit tricky. unfortunately, from a gameplay perspective, part 1 is almost identical to its source material. i had hoped that with so much talk about the game borrowing from part 2’s graphical upgrades that we might also see some of the gameplay tweaks that were introduced there, such as the ability to go prone in combat, and new enemy types like attack dogs that were trained to sniff you out, forcing you to stay on the move. having these elements within part 1 would have given existing players more of a reason to dive back in beyond the visual overhaul. still, this isn’t to say that it’s completely devoid of new content – there’s now a ‘permadeath’ mode for players who can’t get enough punishment, and a speed-run mode to time how quickly you can make it to the end. haptic feedback via the dualsense controller also adds a new layer of immersion, heightening moments of intensity such as grappling an enemy from the shadows. the adaptive triggers also change how you use certain weapons. for the bow, you remove the weapon from your backpack with l2 and then use r2 to slowly pull back the arrow, feeling the pushback in the trigger as you do so. there’s even a handful of new unlockables that can be swiped after you’ve completed the game, including costumes and concept art, but i found myself spending quite a bit of time in the game’s new model viewer. just like with part 2, you can now view a collection of character models as if they’re small figurines, pouring over the sometimes unreal amounts of detail in their facial features. one huge selling point for many gamers out there is the the game’s new accessibility features. part 2 paved the way in opening up new ways for differently abled gamers to enjoy the core experience, and those same features have now been implemented in part 1. with everything from colourblind modes to audio description during cutscenes, navigation assistance and narration of on-screen text, naughty dog has gone above and beyond in making the last of us part 1 as accessible as possible, making this is a huge boon for anyone who was forced to miss out on the game the first time around because of any barriers to entry. i only hope that more developers follow suit. you want to experience the best version of the last of us: with a complete visual overhaul that makes the game’s world and story feel more tangible than ever, there can’t be any doubt that this is the best way to experience naughty dog’s iconic title. you’ve recently replayed the last of us: if the memory of the game is still fresh in your mind then there isn’t an overwhelming amount of new content to draw you back in on day one. with a £70/$70 price tag and not a whole lot of new content to speak of when it comes to the gameplay, the last of us part 1 may be a tough sell for some gamers, but because of its massive leap forward in visual fidelity and making the world more engrossing than ever, it is still the best way to play one of the best games ever made – and that can’t be overlooked. i’ve enjoyed every minute of my time with part 1, and the inclusion of barrier-breaking accessibility features means that a whole sect of gamers will now get to experience naughty dog’s post-apocalyptic story for the first time. even if you don’t nab the game at launch, it’s one that all ps5 owners should add to their library down the line. we play every game we review through to the end, outside of certain exceptions where getting 100% completion, like skyrim, is close to impossible to do. when we don’t fully finish a game before reviewing it we will always alert the reader. no, the original multiplayer component of the last of us has been removed. the left behind dlc is included with the game and can be played immediately. we also expect our journalists to follow clear ethical standards in their work. our staff members must strive for honesty and accuracy in everything they do. we follow the ipso editors’ code of practice to underpin these standards.

26,https://www.dualshockers.com/the-last-of-us-part-1-ps5-review/,DualShockers,90," the last of us: part 1 is bloody brilliant, but this ""remake"" is an almost 10-year-old game that's coming with no new content, a missing multiplayer mode, and improvements that most wouldn't be able to notice without a direct side-by-side comparison. at least for the most part. the last of us: part 1 is an impressive game and some of its visual upgrades are very evident, particularly in cut-scenes where character models have obviously been refined, helping to bring out the performances of the cast even further. likewise, the new lighting method brings out the beauty of its tragic world. spores flicker and sparkle through torchlight and the setting sun basks the desolate city streets and deserted suburbs in a warm glow that you can almost feel through the screen. and yet, despite being a remake, or as i'm going to call it, an 'enhanced remaster', it's very difficult to parse this new, more expensive version from its previous ps4 remaster. naughty dog came out swinging after a leaked video prompted fans to complain about the lack of new features in the game. the studio presented a trailer showing some comparison shots and there was a ps blog post with vague details on modernized gameplay, improved combat, and deeper world interaction, such as cars gently moving as they're shot or leaned up against as cover. i can honestly say i didn't notice. to be fair, how would i even know if there were new animations? i don't keep a video catalog of each game's animations, so if there are one or two new moves, they've meshed in with the rest of this familiar outing. what i can say is that i didn't notice anything from the sequel being backtracked into the last of us: part 1. for example, you can't go prone nor can you hide in the foliage. i found the latter out the hard way and ruined my stealthy approach in the process. there is dualsense support, though, and i appreciated the tactile feedback on the bow and arrow, as well as the gyro-aiming - something not enough games take advantage of, sadly. outside of the spruced-up cinematics and the in-game character models, most improvements are subtle and had they not already been detailed in some of the pre-release promo videos, i wouldn't know they were there. i suppose that's really a testament to the previous versions of the game; they were so well done that my memories of them still hold strong. now, all of this is not to say that there's no value in the last of us: part 1 - there most definitely is, it just depends where you're coming from. for first-timers who have never experienced naughty dog's finest, it's the best place to start. for me, a returning player, it's interesting to see how i relate to the game and its themes after aging (terribly, i might add...) a decade. my tastes have changed and my life experiences have skewed what i find enjoyable and relatable. the last of us: part 1 may be the same game at its core, but i'm not the same man who first played it on the living room floor of my student flat in cardiff. it's a near-perfect experience and a masterclass in video-game storytelling. being able to relate to joel on a paternal level was not possible back when joel and ellie were trying to survive in 720p. now, with crystal clear (dynamic) 4k, and a child of my own, i see what joel sees - and it's haunting. that opening scene with sarah? it never got to me in the past. this time around, my famously stiff-upper-lip definitely faltered. troy baker's pitiful begging as his daughter dies in his arms hit me hard, and being able to paint myself into that picture made the scene all the more harrowing to witness. a decade ago, i just thought ""yeah, that sucks - when can i shoot some zombies?"" from that tear-jerker opening to the first ""oh crap!"" moment where i lost focus and alerted some clickers, right to the final chapter where joel finally earns himself a sliver of redemption, i really can't fault it. not without needless nitpicking, at least. it's a near-perfect experience and a masterclass in video-game storytelling. the cinematography is hollywood-level, as is the acting. the writing can be a little too self-indulgent at times, but it still hits hard when it needs to, delivering emotional blows with joel's rugged gruffness and light-hearted moments with ellie's naivete and her apparent fondness for the f-word. joel and ellie's story is one of survival, parenthood, and redemption. where the last of us: part 2 focused squarely on ellie's dark path to revenge, joel's is essentially going in the opposite direction. watching, listening, and playing along with joel and ellie's relationship is fascinating as a ""proper"" adult. hearing the fatherly concern in joel's questions and the arrogant, self-sure retorts from ellie is something i've heard in my living room a thousand times at this point. initially, joel wants nothing to do with ellie. in fact, this cold, cruel man, who was once a loving father, brother, and friend to many, doesn't blink at a man eating a bullet for a debt he owes to joel. upon learning of what makes ellie so valuable to the fireflies - the militant group joel is tasked with delivering her to - he would just as soon feed her brain a bullet, too. witnessing the evolution of their relationship is a true joy, punctuated with moments of true terror. the world's a nasty place, and outside of the relative safety of the totalitarian quarantine zones, everything goes. unlike other zombie games, you're not playing as an overpowered zombie-killing machine. one wrong move and it's curtains by way of a selection of gruesome death animations. they really are gory and despite having a strong stomach, i was tempted to turn the gore down in the options. every moment is a struggle for survival. bullets are rare and good people are rarer. i estimate that i spent about half of my time in the game with joel squatting down low to stay quiet and to better spot any valuable resources that could be used to help me live a little longer. that said, i did play on the easy difficulty setting so that i could just take in the story - i've already run the gauntlet before, i don't need that kind of stress in my life. but if you really want to take the game to another level and for every encounter to truly be life-and-death, you can up the difficulty and even turn on permadeath. the last of us: part 1's gameplay is nigh-on identical to its previous versions, but i can't say that's a bad thing. the gameplay has aged better than i have... encounters with the infected are still tense and deliberately paced. where other games throw crowds of zombies at the player, the last of us: part 1 strategically places its enemies across its levels, almost in a chess-like puzzle manner. a move in one direction may lead to a big fight you can't win. a move in the other may result in saving a few precious bullets for later. an early encounter in the game got me my first ""oh crap!"" moment. thinking i was clear in making good on my stealthy maneuver, i got a bit too confident and altered a group of nearby clickers. my slow, steady and silent approach was in the wind as the click-clack yacking screams of the clickers blared from my tv. this was the first cock-up on my part, but it certainly wasn't the last. if there's a new death animation in the last of us: part 1, i've probably seen it. the last of us: part 1 finds its worth; it's the best possible version of naughty dog's best ever game. naturally, the infected aren't the only threat - humans are the real bastards, because of course we are. it's a trope that's been done a thousand times before and will be done a thousand times again, but i love how the last of us: part 1 keeps its lines deliberately gray, particularly with the main cast, including joel. he's not a good guy but in this world where it's everyone for themself, he's far from the worst, and the worst really are despicable. i'm looking at you, david, you creepy little git. joel's redemption is bittersweet, and come the end credits, you may wonder what it was all for. i know i did the first time around, but with the benefit of time on my back, i've come to appreciate the nuanced storytelling that much more, and for me, that's where the last of us: part 1 finds its worth; it's the best possible version of naughty dog's best ever game. a neat addition to this 'enhanced remaster' is the inclusion of the standalone prequel, left behind, featuring ellie in a very short, very sweet, and very sad little prelude story. i would have preferred the multiplayer, though, to give the game some legs to run on in the future, but it wasn't to be. if you're a newcomer wondering what i'm blabbering on about, it would serve you well to have a look at the last of us remastered where the multiplayer mode is still actively being played. the last of us: part 1 is the definitive version of naughty dog's classic. sadly, i'm afraid the conversation, at least among the old guard who first took ellie under their wing all those years ago, will hone in on the economics rather than the breakthrough emotional storytelling and the grounded gameplay. chris has been writing about video games for almost a decade across a handful of publications. now he's landed at dualshockers as multimedia editor, which is a fancy way of saying that he can write words and make them into videos.

27,https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/playstation/the-last-of-us-part-1-remake-review,Android Central,90," the last of us may not have needed a remake, but there's no denying the sheer quality of it. its visuals, from the environment to the character models, look like they're plucked directly from a movie. the new lighting and shadows make for a more realistic experience, without completely changing the atmosphere. its gameplay, especially the shooting, still needs some fine-tuning, but every improvement just serves to make a near-perfect game even better. when the last of us first released in 2013 for ps3, it was praised for its visuals and narrative, setting a new high bar for the games industry at large. when it was remastered for ps4 a year later, naughty dog improved on those visuals even further. despite both versions still being entirely playable — they're less than ten years old and don't feel outdated by any means — naughty dog decided to go ahead with a complete remake, rebuilding its graphics (and more) from the ground up. was it necessary? probably not. but in an industry where photo-realistic graphics means everything to some people, the last of us part 1 is a welcome addition. playing the last of us part 1 on ps5 didn't give me a whole new feeling, because it's how i still remember my first playthrough of the remaster; looking back through rose-colored glasses. side-by-side the differences are stark, but in the moment, it feels the same. a game as good as the last of us always holds up, though, and even though this playthrough wasn't a life-changing experience, it did give me a new appreciation for its sequel and the story as a whole. on top of its rebuilt visuals, naughty dog added a suite of accessibility options, leveraging what it did so well in the last of us part 2. with additional fan-requested modes like permadeath and speedrun, along with unlockable cosmetics and gameplay modifiers, the remake makes a better case for its existence. the core gameplay experience remains the same, barring some ui and menu tweaks to keep it more in line with what the last of us part 2 offers. the real differences and improvements come down to its visuals. aside from more detailed textures, the last of us part 1 delivers more realistic lighting and shadows, more natural water, and denser foliage and particle effects around much of the map. even cutscenes received a revamp, with new character models and improved motion tracking. though naughty dog says that the ai was improved to allow enemies to behave more realistically, i wasn't able to feel a distinct difference when playing. it didn't seem noticeably harder or easier than when i played the remaster, and enemies could sometimes even walk in front of me without noticing me crouched five feet away. its dualsense features include haptic feedback and adaptive triggers, providing tactile cues when drawing a bow or upgrading a weapon. though i honestly could have done without them at an upgrade bench, it did add a heightened sense of tension to the combat when you actually feel yourself shooting a weapon. naughty dog found a good balance between ensuring that the sensations don't take you out of the game, while also making their absence notable, should they be turned off. if you're just here for the story, you'll be pleased to know nothing has changed on that front. it's the exact same dialogue and narrative as the original, and it still packs a punch where it counts. you'd think after 10 years and a few playthroughs it might lose some of its emotional weight, but it doesn't. if anything, it makes me appreciate the story as a whole, including part 2, even more. there's something very visceral and unsettling about the opening of the game now that the world has experienced an actual pandemic, albeit one that doesn't turn people into crazed flesh-eating monsters. and like the remastered edition, the last of us part 1 also includes the left behind dlc. again, the story isn't changed at all, but it looks prettier and helps players get a better understanding of ellie's life before she met joel. its accessibility options have been greatly expanded so that more players can experience the game for themselves. the last of us part 1 offers alternate controls, magnification and visual aid settings, motion sickness settings, navigation and traversal assistance, screen reader and audio cues settings, and combat accessibility that can toggle actions like your weapon sway, whether enemies can see you while not aiming, whether enemies can flank, and more. each of these options serves to open up the game to a wider audience, and naughty dog's efforts on this front should be commended. just like the last of us part 2, part 1 has gameplay modifiers that can be unlocked after completing a playthrough to make your next playthroughs even more interesting. with cheats like infinite melee durability, one shot kills, and explosive arrows, among many others, it keeps the replay experience fresh. there are even options to horizontally flip the world rendering, or enable ""helium"" audio so that all of the audio is pitched up as if filled with helium. other extras that can be unlocked include character and weapon cosmetics, concept art detailing some of the differences between the 2013 and 2022 versions, character and enemy models, and filters that completely change the graphics. it's damn near unplayable in 8-bit mode, but it's a cool visual to say the least. all-in-all, i'm very happy with what naughty dog has done to the last of us part 1. a lot of these changes may have been unnecessary, and i'm not sure i'd shell out $70 for them, but they do a commendable job enhancing a modern classic. despite improving the ui so that the weapon crafting menu and item selection is more consistent with the last of us part 2, it's still not amazing. swapping between weapons, even with an extra holster, can be frustrating in the middle of combat, and there were a few times where i died because i wasn't quick enough to switch my gun or equip a molotov. speaking of its combat, the shooting could use a lot of work to make it more satisfying. third-person shooters already feel clunkier than first-person, and this is especially true in the last of us part 1. i understand that it may be more realistic for weapons to sway a certain amount and for aiming to be less precise — even with the sensitivity adjusted — but it just ends up being an annoyance more than it should. whether or not you should buy the last of us part 1 is a tough question to answer, because the original is still entirely playable. if you haven't played the original for whatever reason, then this is absolutely the version you should get. for those that have played the game on ps3, or even the ps4 remaster, i'd only spend the money if the last of us is one of your favorite games of all time. the gameplay modifiers are fun and it looks gorgeous, but i don't know if those enhancements are worth the $70 to some people. it's also important to remember that this remake doesn't include its factions multiplayer mode at all, and that may sway your decision if that's important to you. the last of us is still one of the greatest games ever made, and it's certainly one of the best ps5 games anyone can play right now. you just need to ask yourself if you'd be better served with this version versus the remaster, depending on how much money you want to spend. the last of us is still as impactful as it was the day it came out in 2013. naughty dog improved just about every visual aspect while retaining the same tense atmosphere and powerful story that fans love. jennifer locke has been playing video games nearly her entire life. you can find her posting pictures of her dog and obsessing over playstation and xbox, star wars, and other geeky things.

28,https://worthplaying.com/article/2022/8/31/reviews/133453-ps5-review-the-last-of-us-part-i/,Worth Playing,90," the last of us was one of the very best games on the playstation 3. it was so good that sony ported it to the playstation 4 with the last of us remastered, which was a darn good port of the game. however, that does make it surprising that we're getting our third version of the last of us in as many console generations. the last of us part i is a remaster of the first game that's been ""built from the ground up"" to bring it more in line with the sequel, both visually and gameplay-wise. it's difficult to say if the improvements justify its hefty price tag, though. to start off, the last of us part i is still the same game as before. it has the same plot, the same characters, and the same structure. while it has been rebuilt from the ground up, it isn't a resident evil 2-style remake. this also means that everything that was excellent in the original, from the engaging characters to the heartbreaking plot, remains engaging and interesting. if you haven't played the last of us in either of its previous forms, then i'd recommend not looking anything up because it's impossible to avoid spoilers at this point, and the last of us is a game that's best played with a blank slate, if you can. the good news is that the last of us part i is an excellent game. everything i said in my original review of the game still holds true now, and if anything, the game has gotten better with age. i don't want to repeat my previous compliments, but know that the last of us is an extremely good game and well worth playing if you haven't. the changes in part i are largely subtle. like the remastered version, the title comes with the left behind prequel dlc, but on the surface, it's very much the same game that you may have played on the ps3. combat in part i has perhaps been updated the most from the original release. if you've played the original title, almost all of the same basic strategies and tactics remain valid. the enemy ai has received a bit of an upgrade, and enemies more proactively flank you and close in on you, forcing you to move out of cover more than you did in the original. it isn't exactly game-changing, but it adds some tension to combat encounters by forcing you to watch your sides more than you used to. the most significant addition to the game is the fantastic amount of accessibility options, which let you tailor the game to play however you like. there are a ton of features for those with accessibility needs, including high-contrast modes, the ability to change huds, subtitles that can cover everything in the game, and more. there is a stunning amount of care given to players who are hard of hearing, have visual or motor disabilities, or need a little something to make the game playable. there are also a number of other available adjustments. for example, if you have trouble with aiming, you can turn on an auto-aim feature, which locks on to the closest foe and can be tailored to be laser-precise or a loose help. if you don't want auto-aim, you can turn on slow motion while aiming to make it easier to line up shots. if you don't enjoy the game's puzzles or can't finish them because some rely on audio cues, you can enable the option to skip them at a push of a button. (this is also nice if you're just playing for the story.) if you don't like stealth, you can enable the option to become invisible while crouching, either for a limited period of time or for however long you'd like. you can manually adjust a lot of specific options, such as infinite breath, enemies flanking less, enemies not breaking free of grabs, and more. these features may not matter to longtime fans, but i think they represent the best addition to the game. allowing players to customize the individual elements of the game goes a long way toward making it accessible to anyone without removing the gameplay entirely or forcing a player onto easy mode. sure, the game is easier if you turn on slow motion than if you didn't have it, but it's only one element of the game that is simpler than the entire thing. i know infinite breath may not sound like much, but i know at least one person who couldn't finish the game because of the stress of the underwater segments, and this setting was made just for them. the last of us was always a good-looking game, but part i really steps it up. almost everything has been improved. character animations are notably better, especially facial animations, and the environments are crisper and more alive than even in the remastered version. it brings the game much closer to the last of us part ii and shows off the difference a few console generations can make even with the same game. it also runs buttery smooth, which is a huge bonus. it is difficult to express how much better it looks without seeing the two side by side. part i gives everything more depth and realism and lends weight to the already believable world. there are a few places where things felt like they could have been cleaned up more, but they were few and far between. it is far and away the better-looking version of the game. part i is an improvement over the remastered version in pretty much every way, but in many ways, it isn't that much of an improvement. it looks better, it plays better, it's clearly a more refined game, but at the same time, it's still very much the same game. that speaks well of the competence of the original game, but it also makes the price tag the biggest barrier to entry. if you own a ps5, you can buy remastered for less than one-third of the price of part i, and the overall experience will still be darn good. even for die-hard fans who probably own the game twice over, the $70 price tag is going to be difficult to justify. that leads to the last of us part i being both the best version of the game and also extremely difficult to recommend unless money is not a concern. the last of us has aged well enough that you don't lose a ton playing the remastered version, unlike the similar remake demon's souls, which took a cult ps3 game that many people had never played and gave it a modern updated release. if you're willing to wait for a price drop or sale, part i becomes far more appealing because it is a wonderful improvement to an already impressive game. aside from cost, there's no reason to go back to the older versions, and the last of us remains one of the best games in the sony library.

33,https://gamerant.com/the-last-of-us-part-1-review/,Game Rant,90,"the last of us part 1 brings the classic title to ps5 with a major visual overhaul but the core experience remains largely unchanged. when it comes to remakes and remasters there is an inherent discussion about value – is the game worth playing for those who haven’t ever played it and is it worth revisiting depending on the changes made to the original product. for the last of us part 1, those discussions have been more heated for a number of reasons, with the value of the remaster varying from person to person. after having spent considerable time with the last of us part 1 it’s hard not to come away impressed. naughty dog has upgraded the visuals of the game across the board, making it look on par with most current-gen games on the market. the game still features the performances from the original, but with a new coat of paint, everything about the last of us part 1 has an added boost of realism. it really is impressive how much visual detail naughty dog was able to layer onto the last of us part 1 without completely redoing the stunning production design that existed before. the developers called their work on the project meticulous, and it feels that way. much of what the last of us part 1 does is modernize the visuals of a ps3-era game to match the fidelity of the current generation. at the same time, that also means that the last of us part 1 does not feature any major overhauls from a gameplay perspective. this is not the last of us part 1 with part 2’s combat and systems. going from part 2 to part 1 is sure to be jarring for veterans, but that doesn’t seem to be the intent of this remake. rather, the focus is on preserving its experience, or what fans remember from 2013. there are some bonuses included with the last of us part 1 that will entice more hardcore fans. a speedrun and permadeath options are included from the start, which will likely satisfy the dedicated last of us players out there. the last of us part 1 also features a ton of accessibility options, which has become standard practice for sony-published games lately and is nice to see here. the last of us part 1 also comes packed in with the left behind dlc. it’s a great, ellie-led story that highlights her life before joel and gives some hints about her behavior in the last of us part 1. one of the things that naughty dog excels at is its ability to craft quiet moments that are mechanically engaging but not focused on intensity or outright combat. left behind has some of the best examples of those in the series. the last of us part 1 is an exceptional game, one whose influence has permeated game development on every level. it features a story that’s on par with any movie or tv series, performances that are emotionally affecting and beautiful, and gameplay that is unbelievably tense. without question, it deserves to be played, and the last of us part 1 is the best version of the game available. of course, with a game this beloved and popular there are tons of people that have already played the last of us part 1 and are looking for reasons to buy the remake. the visual upgrade is a major selling point, but whether that’s worth a $70 price tag will vary from person to person. the lack of the game’s factions multiplayer is likely going to be a sticking point for some as well. in some instances, a remake can feel like a brand new game, but that isn’t entirely the case here. the last of us part 1 is no doubt a better-looking game and the dualsense functionality adds some nice immersive touches to the gameplay, but it doesn’t feel fundamentally different. there’s an exceptional game on display but it was exceptional back in 2013 and 2014 for the remaster. as a result, interest in the game is going to be all over the place. some will see it as a cash-grab, others will be happy it exists for the new fans that will come from the hbo series, and specific fans will appreciate yet another opportunity to journey with joel and ellie in an experience that is one of playstation’s best. an owner of every console since atari, anthony is willing to try any video game, good or bad, but prefers the ones that involve a deep and involving story. with the ocarina of time gladly sitting as his favorite game of all time, anthony is a sucker for any game that has players wielding a fabled sword, but can still appreciate everything from a solid sports title to a game with a deep multiplayer experience. by eventually combining his love of video games with his skills in film, anthony hopes to make game rant a fun place to explore all facets of pop culture.

34,https://gamingbolt.com/the-last-of-us-part-1-review-faithful-to-the-core,GamingBolt,90," back in 2013, the last of us took the games industry by storm. featuring state of the art graphics, finely tuned gameplay and a story that hits you right in the feels, the last of us was a seminal title of its generation. fast forward to 2014, naughty dog and sony remastered the game for the playstation 4, which featured updated graphics and performance parameters. suffice to say that this was the best way to play the game back then. eight years later, naughty dog and playstation, for some reason, decided to remake the last of us for the playstation 5. ever since the game’s announcement, there has been a ton of discourse regarding this remake’s existence and whether it was needed. to be honest, there is no definite answer to that. the dilemma of whether a product has any right to exist is something that comes down to each individual’s opinion, and hence i am not going to debate that matter in my review. let’s get the elephant out the room first. the last of us part 1 is an extremely faithful remake of the original. naughty dog has ensured that they keep the same story beats with some incremental upgrades in other departments. the last couple of years have seen some spectacular remakes like resident evil 2 and final fantasy 7 remake. rather than staying absolutely true to the original games’ visions, the developers consciously ensured that they were vastly different in terms of storytelling and gameplay mechanics compared. however, the enhancements those remakes bought forward cannot be compared with what naughty dog has done with the last of us part 1. the original the last of us was released in an era where full blown 3d open world games were already becoming the norm, whereas the original resident evil 2 and final fantasy 7 came out in an age when 3d gaming was on the rise. so, to expect naughty dog to follow suit with what was done with those games is unreasonable, in my opinion. ""the very first thing you will notice is how spectacular the game now looks on the playstation 5."" this is not to say that the last of us part 1 doesn’t feature any upgrades whatsoever. the very first thing you will notice is how spectacular the game now looks on the playstation 5. built completely from the ground up for sony’s current generation console, the last of us part 1 benefits from major improvements in the animation department. compared to the remastered version, facial expressions have a lot of weight to them, which in turn adds more emotional depth to the beautifully crafted cutscenes. it’s not a secret that the last of us features some of the most moving scenes in a video game, and to see them re-developed on the ps5 is a treat for the eyes. in-game animations like character movement and other actions also see a noticeable jump in quality over the original. joel feels much more agile and natural to control, which in turn translates to better on-field combat and environmental interactions. besides the upgrades to animations and character movement, the last of us part 1 also features noticeable improvements to environments and world assets. the outdoor environments see a massive uptick in quality thanks to increased foliage density and better texture quality. unfortunately, the same cannot be said about some of the interiors. they seem to be using lower resolution assets, though it may be down to that being an artistic choice of making the world depressed and eroded. either way, this is ends up being a noticeable issue nevertheless. the last of us part 1 features two graphical modes- performance and fidelity. fidelity mode pushes the game to run at 4k but a frame rate of 30. performance mode on the other hand compromises a bit on the resolution front but doubles the frame rate to 60. frame rate in both modes was solid in my playthrough, but performance mode was definitely my favorite mode to the play the game on. personally, i find it difficult to go back to 30 frames per second once i experience a game at a higher frame rate. there is also an “unlocked frame rate” option that can be enabled if your screen supports this feature. ""on the gameplay side of things, the last of us part 1 takes a rather conservative approach when it comes to changes."" on the gameplay side of things, the last of us part 1 takes a rather conservative approach when it comes to changes. the combat feels largely similar to the original, which isn’t a bad thing given how good it was. however, i would have loved to see enhanced stealth options, like going prone and crawling. i found their absence to be rather disappointing, given how those options could have enhanced the game even further. their inclusion probably wouldn’t have impacted existing gameplay mechanics, so it’s a bit baffling that this wasn’t included, given that they remade this game from the ground-up. fortunately, enemy and companion ai sees a noticeable bump. your companions won’t simply run or hide in front of enemies as frequently as they did in the original. enemy coordination is better here, which makes the gameplay a bit more challenging, too. i can only imagine how much more challenging this game will be on its highest difficulty, which i think is going to be quite fun for players who love a bit of difficulty. besides these improvements, everything else almost remains the same as the original. you scavenge for resources, craft items, and find new weapons. you will come across the same enemies and characters in the same way as you did in the original. the last of us part 1 is the definition of a faithful remake, at least in the gameplay department. there is also a speedrun mode that enthusiasts will love. this feature tracks your current play time per chapter along with the best time for that chapter. i am personally not a big fan of these kinds of modes, but i could totally see many players appreciating its inclusion. as expected from a first party playstation game, the last of us part 1 uses the dualsense’s flagship features- however, i found the implementation to be quite subpar. of course, there is some resistance experienced in the triggers while using weapons like the bow, but for other weapons i found the experience to be quite inconsistent. for example, when i am using a shotgun, the haptics should respond in a way that passes the impact towards the player. i didn’t fing the implementation to be that impactful. team asobi and astro’s playroom still take the cake as far as dualsense implementation is concerned. ""granted, there are some niggling issues like low resolution textures in some places and the lack of stealth-based gameplay enhancements, but the last of us part 1 still remains an experience like none other. the better graphics, animations, and improved ai make the trip through this brutal post-apocalyptic world worth it again."" 9 years later, the last of us’ gameplay still holds up well, despite the fact that improvements could have been made. it’s gory, visceral, and a ton of fun. the fact that the original was developed with such attention and care and all of that has been faithfully bought over to the remake is what makes it worth it to experience it all over again. granted, there are some niggling issues like low resolution textures in some places and the lack of stealth-based gameplay enhancements, but the last of us part 1 still remains an experience like none other. the better graphics, animations, and improved ai make the trip through this brutal post-apocalyptic world worth it again. game looks beautiful; great animations; improved player movement; improvements in enemy and companion ai. lower resolution textures in some interiors; lack of stealth gameplay enhancements; dualsense implementation is subpar. resident evil village's three-pronged expansion is easy to recommend to fans of the series and the base game, ... the quarry is celebrating halloween with a deep discount and a new outfit pack dlc that will be free to grab u... while it's no secret that discord will be coming to ps5, a new datamine reveals that the integration might be ... one of the writers behind disco elysium has filed a lawsuit against studio za/um following recent departures f... former bayonetta voice actor hellena taylor has, in a new series of tweets, confirmed jason schrier's reports ... a new trailer will go live tomorrow that'll unveil a new ghost-type pokemon for the upcoming rpg duo.

35,https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-part-i-review,IGN,90,"you almost have to admire the hedonism of looking at the last of us remastered, which is still visually impressive eight years later, and saying, “yeah, that looks pretty good, but we can do better.” there’s very little left to be said about the original the last of us, a potent, post-apocalyptic cocktail of stealth, survival, and slaughter that’s revered for its haunting storytelling in an amazingly well-crafted world. you almost certainly knew that. it’s widely lauded as one of the best games of all time and one of the few to get a 10 from ign, but i reckon you knew that, too. in fact, it’s a game so nice they built it thrice, which is where we find ourselves with the last of us part i – now the third version of naughty dog’s 2013 masterpiece to arrive inside a decade. unsurprisingly, this remake takes full advantage of the added grunt afforded to it by the ps5 by delivering astonishing new levels of detail and fluidity in its fully rebuilt world, characters, and animations. it's also equipped with some subtle but well-considered use of the haptic feedback in the dualsense controller, and a simply remarkable array of accessibility options. it’s missing the original’s multiplayer mode, but the result is undoubtedly the definitive way for solo players to experience this modern classic. even so, there is something inherently inessential about it that it can’t quite shake, as a remake of an already fabulous remaster that remains a must-play on hardware only a single generation old. make no mistake: the story here in both the main game and the short prequel, left behind (which is included in part i, still as a separate story), remains as strong, as captivating, and as shocking as it ever was. if you’ve yet to play it, the last of us is a tangled bramble of themes, but naughty dog weaves them together expertly. it may trade in despair, selfishness, and misery, but it’s also quick to lightly breathe on the embers of hope, redemption, and love that glow within its darkness. the upshot is an unforgettable journey that i still can’t recommend highly enough. of course, if you’re familiar with the story already, know that i really enjoyed watching it unfold all over again – from its harrowing opening chapter to its bruising final moments. playing again actually confirmed to me a suspicion i’ve held since playing the last of us part ii: that the original remains superior over its sequel in terms of its story. the last of us part ii is a technically outstanding follow-up with a fascinating tale of its own that completely immersed me, but it’s an almost exclusively grim one, and the heavy spotlight on revenge, hate, and self-destruction is exhausting and disillusioning in a way the original is not. at least, not all the time. the last of us part ii is a masterpiece worthy of its predecessor. taking strides forward in nearly every way, ellie steps into the spotlight and carries the sequel in a manner that feels like the culmination of everything that’s made naughty dog’s blockbuster storytelling so memorable since the original uncharted on the playstation 3. it delivers a layered, emotionally shattering story on top of stealth and action gameplay that improves the first game’s mechanics while integrating a bit more of uncharted’s greater mobility and action. but while part ii is a thrilling adventure, it still makes time for a stunning, nuanced exploration of the strength and fragility of the human spirit. the playstation 4 has one of its best exclusives in one of the generation’s best games. – jonathon dornbush, june 12, 2020 for clarity, the last of us part i has been positioned as a complete rebuild for ps5 – a remake, and not a remaster. despite some hand-wringing to the contrary, this does feel mostly true. while the last of us part i features two display modes – one that achieves native 4k at a targeted 30 frames per second, and another that presents dynamic 4k at a targeted 60 frames per second – naughty dog has done much more here than simply dial up the resolution and crank out an increased framerate. our full performance review of the last of us part i goes into much more technical detail, but broadly speaking all the characters and environments have been remade entirely, and it does show. while i’d agree that it’s been tough to see a vast gulf between 2014’s the last of us remastered and the last of us part i in the video comparisons sony has been rationing out, i will caution that watching two cutscenes smooshed together on a smartphone screen probably isn’t the best way to appraise the meaningful differences here. in-game there’s definitely an overt leap in fidelity and quality. i opted for the dynamic 4k/60fps performance mode and toggled off the film grain, as the higher frame rate makes for far, far smoother camera panning and the default grain effect honestly does little but obscure how good everything actually looks on the ps5. among the most noticeable changes are the facts that foliage is denser, destructible objects are more abundant, and reflections are a standout. the soft lighting is also absolutely stunning, and it’s brimming with details so granular you’ll miss them if you don’t look closely enough. the way rain drizzles down joel’s rifle and snakes down his wet shirt before dripping realistically off the bunched parts of his sleeves had me stopped in my tracks, as did how the light picks up airborne dust and spores in the dankest levels. it’s an absolutely top-shelf visual showcase of what the playstation 5 is capable of. there have been some moderate redesigns for a couple of key characters, too – most notably joel’s smuggling partner, tess. i’ve seen some resistance to the updated tess, but i think it’s a minor but smart change. crafting a tess that more authentically appears to be a woman in her 40s rather than her 20s paints her more as a generational peer of joel’s, rather than a woman younger than his own daughter would have been 20 years after the outbreak. the faint hint of a relationship between the two that perhaps hasn’t always been entirely platonic makes way more sense in this context, and the later bond between joel and ellie is made all the more special when it’s clearer it’s not the kind of connection joel could’ve made with tess previously. the last of us part i does, however, lean on the exact same performance capture, voice acting, and cutscene direction that was used for the original ps3 version, tess included. admittedly, they have been touched up, and i do appreciate how the ultra-high level of facial detail has allowed naughty dog to extract even more subtle microexpressions from the cast’s performances. even the small addition of flecks of spit shooting from a character’s mouth as they shout adds a new layer of intensity to the drama that i admire. it’s a testament to just how high-quality and future proof it all was in the 2013 original that there was simply no need to redo these story sequences wholesale, but it does mean i wouldn’t necessarily group the last of us part i in quite the same category as rescripted, wall-to-wall do-overs like 2019’s resident evil 2 remake or 2020’s mafia: definitive edition. the last of us part i’s new range of accessibility options isn’t something i can personally appraise with the appropriate authority, but it is a tremendously extensive list and an evolution of the multitude of options available in the last of us part ii. there are high contrast modes for low-vision players, automatic navigation assistants for blind and low-vision players, bespoke indicators added to the hud for deaf and hard-of-hearing players, and many, many more assists. additionally, every button command can be reassigned to a different input, and even the core difficulty options are broken up into a series of separate pillars that can be individually adjusted (like enemy strength and awareness, ally effectiveness, stealth tolerances, resource abundance, and player damage resistance). you can check a complete list of the last of us part i’s accessibility options on playstation.blog. i did grow to miss the larger and regularly more vertical levels of part ii; with a few exceptions part i’s levels are generally more intimate and compartmentalised, no doubt thanks to their origins of being designed to run on hardware that first debuted when beyoncé was still 33% of destiny’s child and netflix was still only renting dvds via the post. i also missed the improved melee combat of part ii; part i doesn’t feature the useful dodge move implemented in the sequel, nor the ability to go prone and crawl. the latter doesn’t feel like a huge loss considering the levels weren’t designed to ever require it in the first place, but the lack of a dodge feels odd considering bringing part i’s gameplay more in line with part ii’s was a stated aim. naughty dog has succeeded in a lot of other areas, though – especially with movement, which is a lot smoother than it was in the original and the 2014 remaster. animations that seamlessly blend character movements from one direction to another make them appear less skatey and more connected to the ground. joel and ellie feel a little weightier as a result, which makes them feel more like they’re always really interacting with the world. there have also been tweaks to the enemy ai, who skulk around the environments in unpredictable patterns and who are now far more effective at flanking and working in small teams to flush us out – just as they were in part ii. part i has unfortunately stopped short of copying part ii’s brilliant trick of naming its unfortunate grunts for their buddies to call out in dismay as they stumble across their bodies, though. i thought that was quite a clever way of adding even more gravity to the bloodshed, and it’s a shame it didn’t make the cut. it also reduces, but doesn’t completely eliminate, instances where your ai buddy characters shuffle out into the open during stealth sequences and yet remain unseen, making it crystal clear that this is, in fact, a video game. the last of us part i also features some of the best use of the dualsense’s haptics that i’ve felt to date. all manner of subtle feedback is mapped, from the sharp crunch of racking a shotgun shell to the rhythmic beat of a galloping horse. the triggers for weapons can sometimes feel a fraction too firm by default, but overall feeling what’s happening on screen in your hands adds a lot to the experience. the avalanche of haptics do appear to wreak hell on my controller battery, though – i haven’t finished a session yet with more than a single bar of charge left on it. there is a significant slice of the original the last of us and its subsequent remaster that hasn’t made it into this ps5 remake, and that’s the multiplayer mode known as factions. naughty dog is, however, working on a standalone multiplayer game set in the last of us universe that studio co-president neil druckmann recently claimed is “as big as any of our single-player games that we’ve done, and in some ways bigger.” further details on this untitled multiplayer spin-off are expected next year. finishing the story still takes about 20 hours, factoring in left behind’s two-and-a-half-hour campaign, and when you do it unlocks a pretty extensive set of outfits, visual modes, and gameplay modifiers. messing around with costumes isn’t something i particularly value, although if you find adding a bit of individuality to your second playthrough attractive you may feel differently. i guess even i was temporarily distracted at the idea of making ellie a gran turismo fan. i wouldn’t expect to get much mileage out of the visual modes, either. the comic-style filter, which flattens out the detail and throws a black outline on characters and key objects, is perhaps worth a look – but the bulk of them are simply coloured filters i can’t imagine playing through. the last of us but green! the last of us but red! the last of us but... dark red! the gameplay modifiers, though, are easily the most appealing as far as i’m concerned, as they’re good old-fashioned cheats (a concept that is sadly virtually extinct in the modern games industry). infinite ammo and crafting ingredients, slow motion, one-hit kills – all very neat to experiment with. blasting infected and bandits to bits with unlimited exploding arrows may seem a bit off-brand in the last of us, but it’s bloody fun and more than a little cathartic after being on the run from those bastards for so long.

36,https://www.videogamer.com/reviews/the-last-of-us-part-i-review-a-stunning-trip-into-the-past/,VideoGamer,90," the last of us was released in 2013 for the playstation 3. it brought freshness to the mouldy notion of apocalypse, and it did so with mould—a fungal infection that blighted humanity, causing people to bloom into mounds of ravening stroganoff. not content with that, the developer, naughty dog, released the last of us remastered in 2014, for the playstation 4. the spectacle of our doom was offered anew, this time at sixty frames per second, and it included left behind, a downloadable lump of backstory for the game’s heroine, ellie. now we have the last of us part i, a full-on remake for the playstation 5. the aesthetic, and the graphical oomph, is closer to that of the sequel, the last of us part ii. hence the addendum to the title, locking the games into a pair and giving the story here, especially its lingering end, the feel of historical context. what’s last is prologue. for those in need of a recap, we join ellie, a precocious fourteen-year-old, and her older guardian, joel, on a trek through america in 2033, from boston, through pittsburgh and wyoming, all the way to salt lake city, utah. joel lost his young daughter, sarah, at the start of the outbreak. we find him, twenty years on, still wearing the watch she gave him for his birthday, which has long since broken. it is not the subtlest chunk of symbolism, but it does the job; not only is the world cracked and stuck, in a green and overgrown version of 2013, but our hero, too, has frozen. over the course of their journey, ellie, who is miraculously immune to infection (and who bears the bubbled scar of a bite on her arm to prove it), learns what makes joel tick. gradually, they form a bond. standing, or rather prowling, in their way are ranks of ghouls, and also some infected former-people. the action of the last of us still may be the purest example of post-resident evil 4 panic horror that we have yet had. i’m thinking not just of the third-person shooting, the over-the-shoulder aim, and the 180-degree turn. but of the camera, anchored to your character’s back and heaving with the pant and sway of their movements; you feel hauled through the drama, exhausted. think of leon, the hero of that game, slogging through the autumn-rusted backwoods of spain. like joel, he started the game with a tired breath—a sigh, rather than a gasp—but you got the point: much had already gone down before you picked up the controller. the last of us part i uses the haptic feedback and adaptive triggers of the ps5, which provide added crunch to the combat. note the tiny metallic clink that rings through the controller as you reload a shotgun. the gore has been ramped up to match that of the sequel; when your foes stumble on an explosive trap, for example, the outcome looks as if someone had made a snow angel in a blood spill, strewn with human rubble. the effect of all this is to make joel and ellie’s mission that much more brittle and precarious. when bodies can fly apart at a moment’s notice, in a spray of red dust, you need luck, as much as anything else, to make it through. the question has to be, is this enough? it may seem an odd, not to say precious, idea, to remake a game that hasn’t even acquired the dust of a single decade. shinji mikami may have waited a mere six years before taking another swing at resident evil, but the leap, from the quavering polygons of the playstation to the plush gloom offered by the gamecube, was far more striking to behold. here the difference is one of degrees. notice the dank chill that joel snaps awake into, at the start; the subtitle, seconds before, reads “summer,” but you can feel the warmth has long since drained from him. and look at the heightened fluster on the face of joel’s partner, tess, as she battles the heat of a boston day and the flare of oncoming brutality. the enhancements to the lighting and the environments lend greater texture to the grim vision on offer, but what makes this effort worthwhile is the facial animation. the original belonged to the first generation of console hardware in which you could hang a major plot point on a look. (and hang it did.) for the remake, naughty dog has squeezed further life from the actors’ original performances—fitting, for a game about lives in an unending squeeze. tess is now more believably weathered. she doesn’t just look like a woman who has been through hell, but a woman for whom hell has become humdrum. she looks older, too, which is a welcome rarity; not the least of the game’s blessings was always its attitude to age. we spend its fifteen or so hours in the company of creased and greying souls, gripped, here and there, by the presence of the young. both share a private pitch of understanding, one being as near death as the other in this grave new world. whether or not many will decide to make the trip will, i suspect, come down to price. some will wince at the notion of submitting to over a dozen hours of pain and paying £70 for the privilege—doubly so if they already own the game in its older forms. others will pay it in a heartbeat. (could the blow not have been softened by including this on the premium tier of playstation plus?) whatever you decide, naughty dog has outdone itself here. it has taken us back to the moment at which it leapt from being a studio known for light and breezy platformers to a master of blockbuster weight. the last of us part i is a beautiful thing to behold, honouring your recollection by surpassing it. 2013 never looked so good; you would think that time had stopped.

beyond anything i expected - you're not going to change your opinion about anything you liked or didn't like nine years ago. for me, however, the last of us part 1 is the perfect excuse to return to one of my favourite games of all time. where the last of us part 1 goes above and beyond a standard remaster is in its visual upgrade. from the moment you meet sarah in the opening scene, i was shocked by how good it looks. the level of detail added, alongside the reworked facial animations and overhauled lighting, means part 1 looks as much like a ps5 release as any other exclusive. the world isn’t as complex as part 2’s, with larger open areas still absent, but the games are comfortably on par visually, which is remarkable for a nine-year-old game. the only difference i can really discern is it feels like part 2 is a little more atmospheric. seattle seems just a little more smoke-filled and decaying than the remade east coast ellie and joel explore. the fidelity and performance visual options also allow you to prioritise what you prefer. i played through the last of us part 1 in the performance-focused mode and it ran flawlessly. prioritising resolution will make the game’s world look even more beautiful. it is also incredibly polished, as you’d expect from a naughty dog game. i encountered just one bug in my time with it, when a section of the top left of the screen flickered here and there in the middle chapters. aside from that, the last of us part 1 looked perfect and ran without any issues whatsoever. visuals aside, the last of us part 1 is still just a phenomenal game. i probably don’t need to wax lyrical about everything it does well, naughty dog just tells one of the best stories of the last three generations. the story is brutal and emotional, led by joel and ellie’s central relationship. as shocking moments happen and relationships change, naughty dog tells you the story it wants to, even if it doesn’t make for the happiest of tales. get ready to experience some of the most memorable moments in any playstation exclusive again. the devastating opening scene, giraffes, that ending, some scenes still give me goosebumps almost a decade later. the writing, performances, world design, set-pieces, and character development are still incredible across the board. the last of us is a must-play, in whatever form you play it. since the last of us part 1 falls somewhere in the middle between remake and remaster, though, anything you struggled with in 2011, you likely will now too. i’ve always been an apologist when it comes to the last of us’ gameplay. i think the slow, cumbersome nature of it works in a post-apocalyptic world where the infected are unpredictable and every bullet counts, but i completely understand if it simply feels awkward to you. in the remake, not many changes have been made to the gameplay. entering cover and shooting still feels imprecise, switching between weapons is overly complicated, and it takes a while to craft anything. when stalking a couple of enemies or creeping past clickers, everything feels fine, it’s only when you’re faced with five or more enemies running at you and you’ve only got a few bullets in each of your guns that the flaws become issues. when it gets busy, the action isn’t as fun or precise as i’d like, but the same can be said about part 2. again, i don’t have a huge problem with how the last of us part 1 plays, but it’s obvious that the gameplay isn’t industry-leading like the storytelling and world-building are. also, while the last of us part 1 is the best way to play one of playstation’s best games, i think the remake’s price needs to be questioned a little. yes, naughty dog has treated the game more like a remake than a remaster, although i don’t fully consider it the former, but £70 is steep for an upgraded version of a nine-year-old game. it’s also missing the factions multiplayer that was a huge component of the original package. the same was said about demon’s souls at the launch of the playstation 5, which is a game with a more significant upgrade over its original version. you’ve simply got to question whether the upgrade is worth the price of a brand new ps5 exclusive. for me, the last of us is a must-play game, but £70 is a lot to pay for what is mostly a visual upgrade. if you’re not too concerned by the price, you’re in for a treat. the last of us part 1 is a gorgeous version of one of playstation’s best games. the visual upgrade alone gives new life to joel and ellie’s debut story.

40,https://www.psu.com/reviews/the-last-of-us-part-i-review-ps5/,PlayStation Universe,90," the last of us part i ps5 review. on the face of it, the last of us part i presents an undeniable offering. it is, by far, the absolute best version of the last of us, a game of a generation calibre effort that has arguably defined the sky high production values that have underscored and set player expectations for every playstation studios title since its release. on the other hand there is also a legitimate and sadly timely economic conversation to be made here, since after all, sony seem quite happy to charge $70 for a game that content-wise at least, is overwhelmingly similar to the last of us remastered which is still available for around $10 or can be had for free via playstation plus collection. so just to address the massive elephant (well, giraffe) in the room, the last of us part i is content-identical to the last of us remastered, albeit without the inclusion of the ‘classic’ factions multiplayer. this means that the story, character arcs and left behind dlc are all structurally identical to what you had when the last of us released all those years ago. in a sense this is something of a disappointment because the $70 rrp for the last of us part i might have been easier to swallow if it was delayed and bundled with the upcoming rework of the last of us factions; a seemingly ambitious effort that is deemed to be one of the studio’s biggest projects to date. as it is however, the last of us part i can only really be sold on its own merits and in that, your mileage will vary greatly depending on your circumstances. given that the last of us part i is functionally a repeat of the game that we all played in 2013 (the last of us) and then again a year later (the last of us remastered), i’m not going to harp on at length about the narrative, game mechanics and characters, other than to say that the premise of a world weary father escorting a girl across post-apocalyptic, amoral north america through a four season span is still as compelling as it ever was. then there’s the combat too – an often wincingly brutal affair that would be bettered in the eventual sequel, the fact remains that taking out groups of thugs, infected and clickers, will never not be satisfying and it has aged extremely well in that regard to say the least. with its essence resolutely unchanged and that raw, emotional core very much still intact, the last of us part i represents the original the last of us story in its most perfect and refined form. certainly, the most obvious improvement that the last of us part i brings to the table is the visuals, which have been upgraded significantly over what we saw in the last of us remastered on ps4 and even ps4 pro back in 2014. quite simply everything has been overhauled from a visual standpoint in the last of us part i to bring one of the best survival horror games of all time kicking and screaming onto ps5 hardware. the last of us has always quite rightly been heralded for its vivid, living depiction of an apocalypse where nature is attempting to regain her domain – a certain far cry from the shop-worn dusty and scorched earth scenarios that are associated with the genre. starting with the game world then, the last of us part i leverages the massive leap in processing power that sony’s current generation console provides to pack in a gargantuan amount of fine detail that just wasn’t there or possible before. every nook and cranny of the trek that the last of us part i takes players on as it spirits players across north america is jam-packed with detail. from an appreciably huge increase in flora and fauna throughout, to much more dense fields of debris, puddles (which are now much more reflective of the environment) and more besides, the post apocalyptic north america that the last of us part i depicts simply feels so much fuller and more fleshed out as a result. beyond the realms of mother nature, so too has the destroyed beauty of the civilisation that came before been granted a similar bounty of staggering visual improvement. though the architecture of notable landmark structures such as the capitol building have been decked out with a much higher degree of ornate detail that gives the effect of the last of us part i looking like a high-powered tech demo, so too have the more mundane structures and buildings been granted a similar uplift in detail that just wasn’t before. this lends a whole heap of weight behind the notion that this isn’t the same game remastered, but rather an all new product that has been remade from the ground up to better match the original ambitions of naughty dog’s cadre of talented artists. further afield, the huge uptick in facial detail and overall fidelity that the character models now boast also stretches far beyond a seemingly cynical upgrade too and serve a much greater purpose beyond the surface. conversations now carry more emotional and nuanced heft as the wider range of more detailed facial expressions and improved character likenesses helps to enhance the intensity of the numerous emotional traumas and heartrending tragedies in ways that just weren’t able to be accomplished before. then there are the sheer amount of new visual effects that have been woven into the tapestry of the last of us part i’s evocative presentation. not only has texture detail seen an obvious and eye-opening increase across the board, so too has a range of all new lighting, shadowing and reflection effects work that makes the last of us part i look every bit like the contemporary, stunning playstation studios effort that it was always going to be. likewise, the various environments also feel much more destructible than before, with bullets smashing against walls and items that are dotted around the world, creating a spectacle that you wouldn’t be able to replicate in the ps3 and ps4 versions of the game. the last of us part i also offers up a bevy of different visual presets for players to choose depending on their preference, too. not only are there the usual two fidelity and performance modes which render at native 4k resolution/30 frames per second and dynamic 4k resolution/60 frames per second modes respectively, but owners of vrr compatible displays have another two visual modes to enjoy on top of that thanks to a special uncapped framerate toggle that can be used. when the framerate is switched to uncapped on a vrr compliant display, the last of us part i permits up to 120 frames per second with performance mode enabled, resulting in a substantial drop in resolution. however, if the uncapped toggle is enabled against the fidelity setting, the last of us part i outputs at the higher detail setting with a 40 frames per second target. given the sheer amount of precise, up close and pin-point detail that is generously awash throughout the last of us part i, the fidelity preset proves to be a more compelling option here at first than it does in other games with similar choices. unfortunately, when fidelity mode is enabled in the last of us part i, whether the framerate is uncapped or not, the framerate becomes quite unreliable, noticeably dipping especially deeply whenever ellie or joel decide to switch on their torchlights in dark, detail-rich environments. it’s a shame certainly, but hopefully this is an issue that can be optimised out of existence in a future patch. all of that said, the last of us part i doesn’t just provide us with the best looking version of one of the best playstation games ever made, but also a genuinely stunning ps5 effort that easily stands shoulder to shoulder with the best looking games that the console can offer. this is one absolutely beautiful game, make no mistake. the danger of course, is that if you haven’t played the last of us for a few years and you hop right into the last of us part i, you’re likely going to think that the substantial visual advances that the developer has made here were there all along. essentially, it would be like the last of us part i is always how you ‘remember’ the last of us looking, despite the fact that the ps3 and ps4 versions of the last of us aren’t even a patch on what the last of us part i is doing here visually speaking. of course, side-by-side comparisons very quickly reveal the absolute gulf of detail and fidelity that exists between the last of us part i and every other version of the game released to date, but you’re not always going to have those comparisons to hand which is what will likely contribute to the mistaken (though understandable) idea that the last of us part i is actually less of a visual leap than it actually is. on a surface level, naughty dog has implemented other improvements that supplement the visual upgrades quite nicely and arguably the biggest of these is the new 3d audio implementation that has been engineered for the last of us part i. much like the visual improvements that naughty dog has brought to the table, so too does the implementation of 3d audio serve to double down on the cut-it-with-a-knife atmosphere that permeates every minute of the last of us part i. in its more intense moments, the 3d audio of the last of us part i plays an expected but still keenly palpable role. hearing enemy scavengers sneak around a long abandoned hotel, crunching their feet over nearby shattered glass as they attempt to manoeuvre around to your position has never sounded more visceral. meanwhile, in the quieter moments of the last of us part i, the 3d audio also serves to reinforce the atmosphere further still, as individual raindrops can be heard drumming down on the ruined chassis of nearby motor vehicles, while the call of nearby birds and other wildlife can be heard all around in the more rural environments of the game, underscoring the massive leap in immersion that the last of us part i brings over its ps3 and ps4 predecessors. a quick word about the ai, too. it’s certainly worth mentioning here that the enemies are much more switched on than they are in previous iterations of the last of us. still capable of flanking moves and those sorts of basic tactics, the various foes that you’ll encounter in the last of us part i are generally much more aggressive and leverage cover a lot more frequently, often engaging the player directly before retreating back into cover and even oftentimes ignoring any allies that joel or ellie may have with them in battle. sure, it’s still not perfect and the enemy attack patterns can be predicted easily enough, but it still represents a significant improvement over what we’ve seen before. another aspect of the last of us part i that makes the most of the potent ps5 hardware is the loading speed. now just taking seconds to get into a game from a cold boot and providing near instantaneous loading of save states from within the game itself, getting back on track with joel and ellie’s journey has never been quicker. away from the audiovisual and loading speed side of things, though it might appear that the last of us part i is a straight one-to-one re-release of the last of us: remastered, it isn’t quite that either. though the in-game content, story, enemies, locations and other related events are the same as they always were, naughty dog has put some frankly massive work into the accessibility side of things, bringing the last of us part i into seamless functional parity with 2020’s the last of us part ii. something else that naughty dog has added to the last of us part i is a new speedrun mode. engineered for the last of us experts keen to beat the game as quickly as possible and representing a compelling incentive for finishing the game, speedrun mode creates its own mini-ui which tracks your current play time, personal best chapter time and the name of the current chapter. it’s a neat addition, for sure. ultimately, there is a key concern about whether or not the last of us part i needs to exist at all given the conservative approach that has been taken to the source material, in addition to the fact that the last of us remastered is still freely available. the answer is of course a resounding yes, since the stunning amount of work that has gone into the accessibility side of the last of us part i has meant that deaf and blind gamers can finally play one of the best action adventures ever for the very first time. certainly in the last of us part i, naughty dog have once again gone the extra mile and then some when it comes to the engineering of accessibility options. from a high contrast mode, cinematic descriptions, an enhanced listening mode, customisable dualsense feedback and even traversal audio cues that can aid hard of sight and blind players alike, this marks the very first time that blind or sight challenged gamers will be able to play the last of us and that achievement should absolutely be commended. hard of hearing and deaf players are also ably catered for too by the generous selection of accessibility features that the last of us part i prescribes. from full story and combat real-time subtitles to a range of customisable ui elements, naughty dog are doing the good work here by catering for as a broad a spectrum of disabled gamers as possible and that too, should be shouted from the rooftops. for folks that have played and completed the last of us before, the appeal will be arguably narrower but still potent. this is still the same game you’ve loved, played and completed across two other platforms over the last decade, but it feels and looks refined beyond belief – again, it bears repeating that the last of us part i is by far the best way to play one of the best games ever made and as a super-fan of the series, i would certainly say that i fall into this group. however, i can also completely understand why others might feel short changed by the relative lack of bespoke new content for the last of us part i to justify handing over $70 for a game that they’ve technically played and completed at least two times previously. if however, you have the sorts of disabilities that have now been addressed by the last of us part i’s suite of accessibility options, or happen to be part of a vanishingly small group of players that has somehow missed out on playing the last of us on ps3 and then again on ps4 in its remastered form, then the last of us part i is quite simply essential in every way that a video game can be and you should put down the appropriate stacks to buy it right away. there’s no denying that the last of us part i might be a tough sell to folks who expected a reworked content offering in line with the overhauled audiovisual presentation and other technical advances. for those with accessibility needs, the lucky few who have yet to experience the last of us or even just the number of players who want to immerse themselves in the ultimate form of naughty dog’s opus, the last of us part i makes a more than compelling case for its existence and stands shoulder to shoulder with the best games on ps5. the last of us part i releases for ps5 on september 2, 2022. a pc version is currently in active development. there's no denying that the last of us part i might be a tough sell to folks who expected a reworked content offering in line with the overhauled audiovisual presentation and other technical advances. for those with accessibility needs, the lucky few who have yet to experience the last of us at all or even

42,https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/08/31/the-last-of-us-part-i-review-ps5/,TheSixthAxis,90,"it’s been less than a decade since the last of us originally launched exclusively on playstation 3, and we’re now already getting a remake. painstakingly rebuilt for sony’s flashy ps5, and with a pc release also in the works, the last of us part i is the perfect entry point for those who have never experienced this brutal classic, while also giving diehard fans a decent excuse to double or triple dip. so, what are players getting for that divisive £70 asking price? the last of us part i packs in the original game, as well as the left behind story dlc and some all-new bonus features and content. the fantastic factions multiplayer mode is missing, but that’s for obvious reasons. not only is naughty dog preparing to show more of its new tlou online experience, the ps4 servers for the last of us remastered are still live and well populated, even to this day. if you’re dropping money on the last of us part i hoping for completely new levels and cutscenes, you’ll be left sorely disappointed. content-wise, it’s almost exactly the same as the original game and its dlc, albeit having undergone a masterful makeover. there are some fun extras there too though, including speed-running and permadeath modes, as well as an advanced suite of accessibility options that take a few steps beyond those found in the last of us part ii, and dualsense haptics. seeing this game in motion, the difference here is truly night and day compared to previous iterations. when naughty dog officially unveiled this project, director neil druckmann said it had allowed the studio to realise the original vision they had for the last of us, unburdened by the limits of legacy hardware. it really shows. from that very first frame, the amount of passion and technical prowess that’s gone into this remake is astoundingly apparent. from the way tiny cordyceps particles dance in the light, to the individual grey hairs and wrinkles adorning joel’s gorgeous mug, the level of detail here is staggering. in case you wanted further proof that this is a remake and not a remaster of a remaster, just look at some cutscene footage. naughty dog has gone back and analysed performance capture for the original game from a decade ago, leveraging the power of ps5 to create more lifelike facial animations. the game’s cast of characters become all that more compelling and believable, their interactions carrying more weight and emotion with every subtle eye movement or subtle gesture. it’s truly uncanny stuff. the backdrop upon which their gritty post-apocalyptic saga takes place is equally as impressive. again, naughty dog has rebuilt these environments with the benefit of modern hardware; from suffocating, fungi-infested sewers to busy streets and snow-covered forests, the last of us part i is hardly lacking in visual variety, either. another impressive detail is the enhanced destructibility with surfaces chipping and breaking apart under fire, dialling up that sense of immersion to 11. saying that the gameplay has been completely overhauled would be grossly misleading. without playing them side by side, you’d swear part i feels exactly the same as the original, albeit slightly smoother. don’t go expecting joel to jump and crawl like ellie does in the last of us part ii. if there’s three things he hates it’s jumping, crawling, and golf. jokes aside, while playing this remake we never felt like these additional mechanics were needed, though it does inherit something else from its sequel. we get to see the same dynamic ai controlling the minds of enemy and ally npcs alike, naturally dancing between cover while trying to outmanoeuvre one another. maybe it’s more of a testament to how well designed tlou’s combat has always been, but we played the same skirmish in both the ps4 remaster and remake with dramatically different results. oh, that’s another thing passed on from part ii: the option to boot up and replay your favourite encounters from the main menu. there are other touches too, such as the improved weapon upgrade workbench. the majority of changes here still feel cosmetic, though they amount to one of the best-executed video game makeovers we’ve seen to date. as someone who feels an increasing need to shotgun playthroughs beneath the pressure of an ever-growing backlog, i spent a hefty chunk of my time absorbed in part i’s photo mode. there’s a good spread of tools here, perfect for capturing the game’s gorgeous overgrown vistas or moments of bloody carnage. while not quite as good as the photo mode in days gone, it has a brilliant frame forward feature, meaning you don’t have to be quite so precise with timing snapshots. expect your social media feeds to be chock full of photos from the last of us for the next few weeks. modernisation can be tough in video games, especially when venturing into the realm of the remake. it requires a careful balancing act that could easily end in a developer going too far, plastering over a game’s flawless foundations or stripping it of its soul. with the last of us part i, naughty dog knew exactly when to apply the brakes, retaining the frantic feel of its combat and survival mechanics while dramatically improving every other aspect of this playstation classic. thanks to the remake, it’s just as essential today as was back when the last of us made its game-changing debut. truely excellent they made this game fully accessible. a lot of people can play it now who could not do so before. we do not license content or design to any other site. no element of this site can be used without written permission. all content should be considered opinion. article posters are the individual owner of the article content. we are not affiliated with any third party.

43,https://wccftech.com/review/the-last-of-us-part-i-cant-escape-your-past/,Wccftech,90,"few game studios have come close to matching the level of cinematic quality as naughty dog had some nine years ago with the original release of the last of us for playstation 3. critics and fans alike praised the title, and that recognition was certainly well deserved. two years later, this same title was given an overhaul for playstation 4 while keeping the content and experience largely identical to that fans had played only a console generation before. now again in 2022, naughty dog is bringing their journey to the west to a fresh console generation that may leave some wondering if such a sudden remake was necessary for such an acclaimed gaming experience with the last of us part i, remade for playstation 5. for many, the last of us part i remake might be the very first time they step into the well-worn shoes of a smuggler named joel and the package he’s agreed to deliver way out west. because of that, i don’t wish to delve too deeply into the narrative so players can experience this sorrowful tale for themselves. not a zombie survival story in a traditional sense, the last of us part i still captures that desolation and the way various folks just try to survive after a global pandemic or outbreak completely upends typical daily life. with infection onsetting soon after breathing in infected spores, any hope for a cure can bring even the hardiest of folks to desperation to see that opportunity through until the end. that opportunity comes from ellie, a young girl who’s proven to be immune some weeks after being bitten by an infected soul. thus begins joel’s journey to safely guide and deliver her to a faction of survivors who may very well be able to find a cure or solution for the apocalyptic outbreak. whether you’re experiencing joel and ellie’s journey for the first time with fresh eyes or gearing up for a third (or eleventh) playthrough, the last of us part i offers that same gripping narrative neil druckmann’s team brought to life two console generations ago. fans that knew every word of bill’s raving monologues or the reverberating sound of a clicker stalking through underground pathways will be pleased to know that the original voice work remains intact with some overall improvements in the audio fidelity to take advantage of sony’s tempest audio tech if you happen to play with headphones. the very first time i fired a rifle, i had to turn around and make sure there wasn’t someone aiming at joel, only to find out it was simply the echoing off a nearby wall. keeping the original vocal performances can be a bit of a mixed bag, especially with how often you’ll hear steven jay blum shout callouts to his fellow bandits. while the voice work remains intact, the character models and faces themselves have been completely overhauled, leading some like young ellie to look like completely different characters on playstation 5. the original motion capture was left intact, so this is merely some reworked designs over the existing character rigging and modeling. this can lead to some unintended situations and many of the same graphical bugs that were present in the prior two iterations of the last of us (albeit at much lower frequencies now). just as there are subtle differences in each time joel shuffles around or picks up a new item, there are the same scripted animations of joel raiding to grab every spare bullet or crafting supply in the area as he crouches through an abandoned locale. from a purely mechanical and gameplay standpoint, this is the absolute best way to play the first story of the last of us. subtle changes to the enemy ai and challenge turn each encounter into its own miniature battleground. ammo is just as scarce as its ever been, forcing joel and ellie to rely heavily upon discarded bottles and iron pipes more often than the sidearm in the back pocket. sure, much of this challenge is alleviated when playing on a lower difficulty level, but playing on grounded or the difficulty level just below highlights just how meticulously crafted the combat has become. innovations from the last of us part ii are neatly intertwined into the combat here in the part i remake and if you were to play the two back to back, you’d clearly see the enhanced combat that even the playstation 4 remastered edition of the last of us didn’t yet have. the consistent fidelity of naughty dog’s recent ips on playstation 4 and playstation 5 is nearly peerless. that sentiment is even greater with the last of us part i. the foundation was already impressive even on playstation 3, but this full remake is clearly pushing the fidelity of the middle of the latest console generation. both cutscenes and gameplay hold the same impressive detailing for everything from the pores on ellie’s nose to the age and scratches on her short pistol. save for the few cutscenes that lock the camera in place, players have free reign to slip into photo mode and have full control of lining up shots and playing around with the animations frozen in time (and a frame-by-frame advance to get that perfect shot). it isn’t a new revelation to have a photo mode in a sony title, but this is the definitive game to just take a moment and take in all of that natural splendor. as joel and ellie’s journey comes to a close and the credits begin to roll, naughty dog has thrown in several additional features and bonuses to unlock through a cache of credits. even on its lowest difficulty, completing the campaign rewards players with enough credits to purchase every costume and weapon skin as well as most concept art and gameplay modifiers, assuming they found enough collectibles. it’s rather silly that ellie gets more than a rucksack full of t-shirts, mostly based on playstation ip that might not have existed post-outbreak whereas joel mostly gets different flavors of flannel. even the weapon skins are very few in number, leading to only a couple of specific weapon types. however, it’s the unlockable graphic/audio modes and gameplay modifiers that make it well worth replaying the last of us part i remake all over again the moment you finish the first playthrough. for ease of use, there are a number of modifiers for one-hit kills or infinite ammo and crafting materials and even an upgrade to gain the exploding arrows that used to be exclusive to the sequel. one of my personal favorite modifiers was an option to mirror the gameplay world while keeping the player models intact, something that was first present as a secret feature added to the demon’s souls remake at the playstation 5’s launch. content-wise, you’re getting the same vocal performances from the playstation 3 release of the last of us and the same story beats word for word in addition to ellie’s left behind dlc expansion that is best enjoyed after completing the campaign. no single-player content is left lacking and remains intact in its entirety with more aftermarket parts than just a fresh coat of paint. however, the removal of the factions multiplayer that was present within both prior releases of the last of us is sorely missed and easily would have been another source of many hours of enjoyment just as the last time i played this experience. the full $70 price point also feels like a crucial part of naughty dog’s magnum opus has been stripped away, especially with the multiplayer component of the last of us part ii yet to arrive. even without the price tag accompanying this remake, the last of us part i feels intended to be the first taste for players that might not have experienced this journey before or might be their first taste of a sony blockbuster. for those that find the full price difficult to swallow, the playstation 4 remaster is available in compliments of the playstation plus game collection. the last of us part i is a testament to how timeless this cormac mccarthy-inspired tale is. fully remade for sony’s latest console generation, if this is the first chance a player has to experience the post-outbreak tale, it’s without a doubt the best version to play. both visual and mechanical enhancements bring this title to life as no other naughty dog game has done before. however, the omission of the multiplayer component is lamented by fans of the original that cannot be overlooked for keeping the last of us part i from being a perfect gaming experience. worthy of being hailed as a potential game of the generation when it was first released, the last of us part i is fully remade for a new generation of playstation consoles. with some of naughty dog's best graphical tech to date, this is one you'll have to see to believe.

44,https://www.cgmagonline.com/review/game/the-last-of-us-part-i-ps5-review/,CGMagazine,90," the last of us part i is a remake from the ground up from naughty dog studios, and they have spared no expense in making it look and play incredibly. it took all of about 10 in-game minutes for me to be hooked. i remember sitting on my couch in 2013 thinking “man, that sucks…” when the big plot device happens; now when i saw that scene, it completely broke me. i was sucked in, and i couldn’t let go. to give a little background about the story, it starts off in 2013 (as that was the time of release for the original game) and there is a viral pandemic (how very topical) that affected a majority of the population, turning them in to cannibalistic creatures. not quite zombies, but you get the idea. the player controls joel, and he is tasked with escorting a young girl named ellie across the apocalypse-ravaged united states. it’s an oversimplification, sure, but at its core, that’s what we’re dealing with. when you first load up the game, a few menus prompt you for some input as to your difficulty preferences, brightness, etc. the last of us part i also asks you to select your rendering mode, of which there are three options: fidelity, which favours resolution over framerate (this is your 4k, 30hz output) and targets 30fps; performance, which offers balanced resolution and framerate (4k or 1440p, depending on your video output system settings, and is 60hz) and targets 60 fps; and performance+ mode, which neither of my tvs supported, sadly, as it requires variable refresh rate (vrr). visually, the last of us part i is absolutely stunning. there were multiple times during my playthrough that i just stopped and admired the environments. joel and ellie look stunning in 4k, and the detail put into their character models is remarkable. when compared to the original release from 2013, this remake truly shows the capability of the console to deliver stunning graphics and incredible visuals. naughty dog has gone to great lengths to include expanded accessibility options, allowing you to choose your video experience, as well as things like your navigation and traversal, motion sickness, combat accessibility, and more. being able to customize things like my field of view really made the experience better since i wasn’t getting bludgeoned from the sides nearly as often as i was prior to adjusting the slider. when starting a new game, you’ll have the option to choose your difficulty, amongst other things. there is a new feature in the last of us part i when you start a new game, and it’s called permadeath. permadeath has three settings attached to it, so it’s not the immediate game over that it sounds like: per chapter, per act, and whole game. per chapter resets your progress back to the beginning of the chapter if you happen to die in the game, which can cost you anywhere from 30-60 minutes of game time. per act is very similar, but you get reset to the beginning of the act instead, which can cost you between 2-3 hours of play. whole game is just that: if you die in the game, there goes your whole game file. it gets completely reset back to the beginning. permadeath also has a warning attached that you will be unable to manually save the game. it also says that quitting or exiting the application (dashboarding) while in a dangerous position will be treated as a death. naughty dog was not fooling around when they made this mode, and wanted to make it abundantly clear that permadeath mode is not for the faint of heart. one fun additional feature included in the last of us part i is something called speedrun mode. speedrun mode essentially enables an in-game timer that keeps track of your current time and best playthrough lengths. speedrun mode pauses when you enter a cinematic or a scene transition, and can only be enabled after completing the main story one time first. there will be a small ui representation in the top right corner of your screen that displays the current playtime, the best playtime and the name of the chapter. i really liked this addition, especially with the prevalence of speed runs in gaming of late. one of my favourite things about the last of us part i is the ps5’s dualsense integration. things like haptic feedback and adaptive triggers are very prevalent and are found all over the game in places you’d least expect. for example, in the screen reader and audio cues section of the accessibility settings, there is an option called speech to vibrations. this brilliant feature allows any spoken dialogue to also be played through the controller in the form of vibrations. the vibrations intensify if the dialogue is also intense, and the vibrations are soft if the dialogue is softer, and everything in between. adaptive triggers are also very prevalent in the last of us part i, mostly in the form of aiming your various weapons. i found the most appropriate use of this coming from using the bow. when joel pulls an arrow back and draws it tighter and tighter, you can feel the resistance in the trigger. stuff like this only furthers the immersion for me and i can’t get enough of it. when you are playing a game like the last of us part i, sound is going to be of critical importance. naughty dog has upgraded their audio engine in this title and makes use of the ps5’s 3d audio capabilities. you’ll be able to hear which side of you the clickers are coming from to rip you apart, or you’ll be able to hear the footsteps of npcs walking by like never before. big sound moments become even bigger with the inclusion of 3d audio capability. also included in the last of us part i, is the left behind chapter, that features ellie and her best friend riley. i won’t say much about this as naughty dog recommends it for people who have finished the main story first, but seeing a bit of ellie’s backstory was very cool. absent from the last of us part i is the factions multiplayer mode. naughty dog wanted to focus on the main story of the game, divorced from the multiplayer component. that’s not to say that it isn’t coming, as naughty dog say that they are working on a standalone multiplayer experience set in the last of us universe. improved and tighter controls round out the last of us part i experience. one of the things i worried about before playing was that the controls would feel tank-y. thankfully, this is not the case, as joel gets around about as well as one would expect for a man of his age, in the apocalypse no less. weapon-play is just as smooth. it isn’t unrealistic as there is plenty of weapon sway and other factors in there to make sure that you take your time when lining up a shot, because ammo is scarce in the apocalypse, rightly so i might add. all in all, the last of us part i is a fabulous remake (from the ground up, no less), of a genre-defining masterpiece. all the elements are here from what made the first game so loved, and on the ps5, with all the updates and improvements done, is something that can stand the test of time.

45,https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/the-last-of-us-part-1-remake-ps5-review,Comicbook.com,90," ever since the existence of the last of us part 1 leaked last year, i've been firmly in the camp that believed naughty dog's iconic playstation game didn't need to be remade on playstation 5. even though i love the last of us and have enjoyed regularly revisiting it since its initial release in 2013, i felt that a full-blown remake for ps5 seemed to be a waste of time for naughty dog, especially since the last of us remastered on ps4 is a more-than-adequate way to still play the game. having now played the last of us part 1 for myself, though, i have found my tune changing quite a bit. while this is a remake that probably doesn't need to exist, i'm more than happy that naughty dog has opted to bring the last of us forward to make the game better than ever before. as expected, the biggest selling point of the last of us part 1 is that it has been graphically revamped on ps5. initially, i thought that the last of us remastered looked great by modern standards, but part 1 has only shown me how wrong i was to think this. the latest version of the last of us doesn't just meaningfully improve the game's resolution, textures, and lighting, but it also freshens up essentially every environment that you'll jaunt through with joel and ellie. each level in the game looks similar to past iterations of the last of us, but there's so much more detail and depth to the locales in part 1. to go along with these improvements, the last of us part 1 is also able to consistently perform at 60fps at a dynamic 4k resolution. this mode, which is the game's performance option, makes for an incredibly smooth experience while still looking stunning. a fidelity mode is also available and lets the last of us part 1 run at native 4k instead. you really can't go wrong with either mode, but for me, i didn't think that the slight dip in resolution was worth the frame rate trade-off. when it comes to the visual upgrades seen in the last of us part 1, far and away the thing that impressed me the most came with the game's character models. joel, ellie, and all of the other familiar characters in the story have received literal facelifts. facial animations and expressions in the last of us part 1 are likely the best i have ever seen in a video game and make the performances from the game's cast that much better and more believable. what truly blew me away with this aspect of the last of us part 1 came with just how subtle some of the character expressions now are. while the grand, emotionally impactful parts of the last of us hit harder than ever before, it was the smaller one-on-one moments between characters that stood out to me the most this time around, largely due to what the facial models are now capable of. likely the biggest disappointment for me with the last of us part 1 is that there have been minimal improvements to gameplay. in a general sense, i don't think that the gameplay mechanics from the last of us have aged all that poorly, but compared to what is seen in part 2, it does make the original installment a bit harder to go back to. the most notable change to gameplay in part 1 comes with improved ai for the enemies that you'll face. as someone who played on survivor difficulty throughout both the core game and left behind, i did notice that foes were much more strategic with how they would approach a combat situation. notably, i got flanked far more often in the last of us part 1 than i can ever recall in the original game or remastered. additionally, companion ai in the remake is far more stealthy and won't blatantly step out of cover to reveal themselves. these gameplay alterations are subtle, but they do help with part 1's sense of immersion, especially when accounting for the aforementioned environmental improvements. outside of moment-to-moment gameplay, naughty dog has also made a handful of smaller tweaks to the last of us part 1 that were seen in part 2. joel's process of upgrading weapons now plays out in an animated fashion, similar to what was seen with ellie in the last of us part 2. additionally, collectibles that you pick up in the game have become physical items that joel and ellie can look at in their own hands. while some of the bigger features seen in the last of us part 2 weren't added to part 1 (improved melee system, the ability to go prone, etc.) it is good to see that naughty dog tried to incorporate some qualities that were found in the sequel. as someone who has played the last of us quite a few times over the years, i did find it somewhat annoying that part 1 locks a number of additional features behind the requirement of first beating the game before becoming accessible. considering that part 1 will likely be a return playthrough of the last of us for many, to have to first play the entire game once again before being able to try out the new permadeath or speedrun options feels a bit short-sighted on naughty dog's part. what's even worse is that playstation did give players the option to unlock speedrun mode prior to completing the game, but this perk is only being included as an added bonus to those who buy the digital deluxe and firefly editions of the last of us part 1. even with this frustration, speedrun and permadeath mode didn't feel like they added a ton to the last of us, although it still would have been nice if these features and many others weren't locked from the get-go. one of the things that has been most divisive about the last of us part 1 is its $70 price tag. this is something that i've been critical of as well, primarily because it seemed like playstation wasn't doing enough with this remake to justify the cost. while i've now played part 1, it's hard for me to speak to whether or not this game is worth the asking price. what i can stress is that the last of us part 1 is a very high-quality product. even though the factions multiplayer mode has been removed and there's little else of note in regard to new additions, it's clear that naughty dog went above and beyond to make the visual improvements to the last of us so remarkable that it doesn't feel as though you're getting ""ripped off"", per se, by buying the game at full retail price. your own mileage may vary in this regard, though. i also just have to say that as a whole, i do believe that the last of us is still naughty dog's best game to date. although it's nearing 10 years old, this title still holds up remarkably well from a storytelling and gameplay standpoint, and in many ways, continues to set the standard for what third-person action games are capable of. to know that the last of us will now age even better thanks to this new remake is something that i'm happy about, especially since an entire new audience might be exposed to the game by proxy of the television adaptation coming to hbo next year. the best thing i can say about the last of us part 1 is that it meets naughty dog's previous claim: this is absolutely the definitive edition of the game. not only do the improved graphics, lighting, and animations make for a better throughline experience, but they also add more emotional resonance to joel and ellie's story than ever before. in the brief history of the ps5, the last of us part 1 is one of the most visually impressive games that i've played so far and it makes me that much more excited to see what naughty dog does with its next wholly new project for the platform. the last of us part 1 is set to release later this week on september 2, 2022, for playstation 5. an advance copy of the game was provided by playstation for the purpose of this review.

47,https://www.gamebyte.com/reviews/the-last-of-us-part-1/,GameByte,90,"there is so much i admire about naughty dog’s the last of us. whether it’s the way the characters are written or how the post-apocalyptic world is designed, it’s a game where i always feel something after putting down the controller. the original the last of us was a standout release for the ps3 and a master-class example of emotive storytelling, visual elements, and combat design. experiencing joel and ellie’s journey across a post-apocalyptic united states was eye-opening to how refreshing naughty dog’s take on the genre was and the power the console had at the time. the relationship between the two characters was poignant, aided by the pacing of the story taking place across an entire year gave them room to grow naturally. but just from replaying the original recently, it was easy to see why naughty dog may have wanted to update its magnum opus. compared to part 2, the character models feel unfurnished, the ai much simpler, and it simply isn’t as accessible a title. that makes for an inconsistent experience, depending on your tastes. with the last of us part 1, these improvements are obvious right off the bat. joel, ellie and the rest of the cast have received graphical upgrades to bring it up to the standards of part 2. using the original motion capture recordings, the studio is able to recreate those performances with improved fluidity and detail. it really makes the characters pop out and feel more lifelike compared to the original, and thus improves the actors’ performances. the environments also look crisper and more authentic, with better environmental storytelling and enhanced lighting. despite having played through these levels time and time again, i found myself frequently stopping to drink in all the extra detail. it makes these spaces much more enjoyable to traverse. naughty dog has also brought over the improved ai from the last of us part 2. enemies will react more realistically to your actions. if an enemy sees his mate get killed, but doesn’t see you, they’ll become vigilant looking for the perpetrator. what makes it particularly impressive is they’ll be able to deduce the general area your attack came from, and their movement pattern changes to reflect this. it gives you a chance to flank them and reposition to come in for a sneak attack. similarly, enemies are a lot smarter when engaging with combat. one will try to flank you while another takes shots at you. they work together more effectively as a team, which makes these sections a lot more challenging than in the original. unfortunately, as a faithful remake, this also allows aspects of that 2013 design to bleed through into this version. for example, waist-high cover points still appear in combat scenarios, a trend i thought we’d moved past in the last generation. areas that had to be stripped back due to technical size limitations also haven’t necessarily been expanded either. naughty dog has done a good job of disguising these aspects of the remake, but it’s still there nonetheless. it’s very obvious you’re playing a 2013 game with 2022 graphics, which can be jarring at times. it’s also easy to criticise naughty dog for not bringing over some of part 2’s more interesting gameplay changes, such as being able to crawl on the floor or dodge attacks. i must admit the absence of these features is a shame, and especially takes getting used to when you’re used to the more fluid and adaptive movements of ellie in the second game. but at the same time, these environments were designed without these features in mind, and so it makes sense why they weren’t brought across. the best question to ask when it comes to the last of us part 1 is: “who exactly is this game for?” the £70 price tag is certainly a lot pricier than we were expecting, and for those who already own the game, it sucks to see there isn’t a discounted upgrade path available. however, the release of this game also opens this game up to many new players. the marketing push will naturally attract new players who didn’t get to play the original on ps3 or ps4, as well as the confirmed pc version which will also bring in a brand new target demographic of gamers. then there’s the expanded amount of accessibility options, making the game approachable to a wider audience of people who may have bounced off the original game for its lack of accessibility. naughty dog has worked with world-class accessibility advocates to ensure the last of us part 1 is the most accessible game the developer has created. all the features from part 2’s renowned accessibility options have made it across here, with even many more making the cut. there’s now a narrator option that describes cinematics similar to a screen-reader, and also a dualsense feature that matches haptic power to the dialogue being spoken. it’s astounding just how much care went into these features, and brings the game on par with part 2 for how accessible it is. this carries across to the left behind chapter too, which was originally a dlc level that expanded ellie’s backstory as well as shed some new light on the relationship between herself and joel. it’s great to see this aspect of the original has been retained, and would have been a weird omission if naughty dog had decided to leave it out of the remake’s launch. however, the same can’t be said for the multiplayer. the factions modes in the original the last of us was a refreshing take on post-apocalyptic pvp, favouring slower-paced score-based matches that really vibed with the community. unfortunately, this is not present in part 1 at all, allowing naughty dog to completely focus its efforts on remaking the story from the ground up. considering the studio plans on releasing its standalone factions game at some point in the next few years, it makes sense to not splinter the communities between multiple titles. however, it will make the wait for that new spin-off all the more impatient. the last of us part 1 is a game that doesn’t feel like it needs to exist, but i’m glad it does. even though that outdated 2013 design still bleeds through, the visual upgrades, combat tweaks and accessibility improvements makes it feel like a brand new title. in time, this will become the de facto definitive edition of the game that will be enjoyed for generations to come.

48,https://www.gamepressure.com/editorials/reviews/the-last-of-us-remake-review-an-amazing-expense/zd5c5,Gamepressure,85," joel and ellie are back in another the last of us entry but this time it’s the same game from 2013 remade from the ground up. is the remake worth the price considering not much has changed? the original last of us is a powerful game that starts with an emotional prologue and ends with a scene that makes you wonder if it was all worth it. it’s a game that has seen the test of time and a sequel that brought the series to the modern era with improved controls and visuals. it makes sense, then, that a remake that bridges the visual gap between the two would be the direction naughty dog would go. it’s a bit controversial, really, seeing that the original received a remastered version already a year after it released to update its graphics and visual output. because the last of us part 1 is the same game but with ps5-friendly makeover, calling it a remake is a bit ballsy considering the experience is technically the same. think of this one as a remastered remastered, if you will, so you may be disappointed that gameplay is identical to the one you played almost a decade ago. if it’s your first time, however, then that’s a different story as this is the definitive version you want to play. playing last of us after playing it years ago is a bit like watching your favorite movie again after seeing it when it first came out in theaters. the emotions you get from certain scenes are still there and you may catch something you didn’t notice the first time you watched it, but you generally know what to expect because you remember the plot. that’s how i felt playing this version of the game considering i first played it back in 2013. certain scenes came back to me right away, but other moments felt new and made me fall in love with the series all over again. of course, if you played the remastered version recently on your ps4 pro and you play part 1 now, you won’t be that enamored. the power of this remake lies in you forgetting the original and picking it up years after your last adventure. because the story is unchanged, the gameplay is the same, and even the combinations to various lockboxes are the very same ones you first discovered years ago, this game will feel too similar and may not be something you will want to play right away. it simply will not be worth its updated visuals—at least, i would have major reservations about purchasing it at its current price. instead, if you are like me and haven’t played the game in a long time, part 1 feels like a masterpiece of a game that tells a poignant story of a man named joel who has to escort a teenager named ellie across a post-apocalyptic united states for the chance to save humanity. it has your usual zombies that want to eat your brains, but the true threat, like most apocalyptic narratives have taught us, are the humans you meet along the way. it’s a game that is dotted with emotional cutscenes after some intense gunfights and it’s one that lets you toy with various weapons and crafting tools to stay alive. at its core, last of us has you exploring various environments from the bombed city of boston to the deserted streets of pittsburgh to a desolate college campus in colorado—each one offering a nostalgic view of the past world juxtaposed by the gritty reality of what life has now become. each area you visit is designed in such a way that it lets you explore its immediate surroundings while still keeping you on track towards your destination and goal. yes, it’s a linear adventure, but you have time to breathe in some of its atmosphere in between combat. when you do get into action, you will notice that the game feels more responsive and less clunky than the original. while you can’t dodge or go prone like you can in its sequel, part 1 improves on weapon handling and offers you various options to adjust your aiming sensitivity to give you a style that works for you. even haptic dualsense features gives each weapon its own sensation so your shotgun feels a lot heavier than your good old pistol. newer menus and various accessibility options make the feel a bit more modern, offering a sleeker ui and features that lets more players enjoy the experience. if it’s been some time since you played the original or if you never played it at all, the last of us part 1 is totally worth its price considering it’s the best way to experience its wonder. otherwise it just reads like a bestselling book with an updated cover. the game’s ai is also much better both from an enemy and friendly perspective. clickers and bandits will now flank you if you are not careful, and you can definitely feel their increased intelligence on higher difficulty settings. even ellie, tess, and anyone else who follows you behaves better than they did in the original. now, they won’t just aimlessly walk into a zombie but instead make more strategic moves before an enemy gets too close. it’s a small touch but greatly makes the game feel more real especially if you play it with stealth in mind. its other and more apparent upgrade is its visuals, of course, and this isn’t just an update to what the game looks like. naughty dog has rebuilt everything “from the ground up” meaning that character models and facial movements have been recreated and re-recorded. this gives each character a more realistic look and expression during dialogue-heavy cutscenes, but it also means cutscenes seamlessly transition into the actual game without any interruption. the high-fidelity visuals also bring the game up to par to those of recent ps5 titles like horizon forbidden west so you can really appreciate the realism in each performance in and out of its more cinematic moments. despite its cosmetic improvements, the game’s skeleton is still the same. narrow corridors with conveniently placed crates for cover are still rampant in your playthrough, and even those repetitive ladder puzzles and areas where you need to help ellie cross a body of water to return. these areas were never a favorite of mine in the original so realizing they are back without any changes feels like a bad case of déja vu. “oh, this thing again,” as ellie puts it, sums it up quite nicely whenever you need to find a wooden platform for her to cross. multiplayer is left out of this remake, and while some had mixed feelings about this mode, it gave the game replayability and was actually quite fun back when everyone was playing it. naughty dog is working on a standalone multiplayer experience for the series so what you get instead are plenty of extras like art galleries, new skins for ellie and joel, and both a permadeth and speed run mode to keep you busy. the left behind dlc is also included in the game so it provides a complete part 1 experience that really sets you up for part 2. for a full priced game, the last of us part 1 asks you to love it again and that you consider it a worthwhile investment. it’s the same game you played back in 2013, but its improved visuals, rebuilt models and environments, and its ever powerful story are reasons why you may want to consider taking the plunge. as i mentioned, if it’s been some time since you played the original or if you never played it at all, this remake is totally worth its price considering it’s the best way to experience its wonder. otherwise it just reads like a bestselling book with an updated cover. combo-centric in design, soulstice may feel familiar to the touch, but does this gothic title have what it takes to hold your attention until the end? the third entry in the series, splatoon 3 offers a distinctive multiplayer experience that makes it stand out from other shooters. but, is this version more of the same? according to our users, the last of us: part i for ps5 was a disappointment - the expectations before the release were higher than the current average user score.

53,https://www.dexerto.com/reviews/the-last-of-us-part-1-remake-review-1919080/,Dexerto,85," in the nine years since it became a console-defining title on playstation 3, few games have managed to capture that must-play blockbuster feel in the same way as the last of us part 1 did. it delivered a perfect combination of thrilling gameplay, groundbreaking visuals, and complex characters that really made the player feel every moment. it was also a brilliant example of video games as art, with huge emotional weight and an unforgettable narrative that questions what truly makes us human. so it’s not really that surprising that a proper remake has arrived. almost a decade after the game originally dropped, and with an hbo series coming soon, it’s also the perfect chance for those who missed out to catch up on one of the most highly-regarded games of all time. still, much of the conversation around this remake has been the price point, with many questioning whether a straight-up remake of a nine-year-old game is worth the $70 price tag. it’s a difficult question to answer, but there’s no denying that the last of us remains an incredible game. the last of us part 1 remake is more than just a visual upgrade, but that’s clearly the biggest change here and it’s what everyone’s been talking about, so let’s focus on that for a minute. like many, i was a little skeptical when looking at the comparison screenshots between the 2014 remaster and this brand new remake. was there really enough of an improvement to make it worthwhile, and to justify buying the game again? what i will say (as if it wasn’t obvious already) is that looking at screenshots and actually playing the game are two vastly different experiences; the last of us part 1 remake looks absolutely incredible in motion, and i feel confident saying it’s one of the most visually impressive games on the ps5 so far. naughty dog has spent a lot of time emphasizing that this remake was built from the ground up, and it really does show. joel and ellie have that ‘so realistic it’s a bit creepy’ look to them, with each facial expression and gesture adding plenty of emotion to cutscenes. while out exploring, the contrast between the dilapidated city structures and the beauty of nature reclaiming the planet is starker than ever before. this visual fidelity is actually most impressive in the small things, like shimmering reflections in puddles on the street, grime that covers the walls down in the sewers, or the way each blade of grass sways and bends when you walk across them. although the visuals are getting most of the attention, there are also small improvements to things like combat and controls, which you might not even notice – they’re subtle, but they do improve things. enemies feel smarter and more reactive, while your travel companions seem better at staying out of your way when sneaking around. 3d audio is also a great addition, especially in the more atmospheric, stealth-based sections of the game. with the pulse headset, i could hear every drop of water, every footstep, and most importantly, the location of nearby clickers. it really does add to the immersion. i’d also like to commend naughty dog on their accessibility options, which are some of the best i’ve seen in a video game. there’s an audio description that narrates what’s happening in cutscenes for blind and visually-impaired players, sound cues to help with traversal and combat, and the option to change button taps to long holds, to name just a few. the dualsense controller is utilized, too, with an option to deliver vibrations that emphasize how voice lines are delivered, whether that’s a shout or a whisper. these accessibility options will no doubt allow even more people to experience the last of us, and that’s something to be celebrated – even if you won’t be using the features yourself. beyond these welcome upgrades, there’s really not much in the way of ‘new’ content in the last of us part 1 remake. when it comes to the core gameplay, naughty dog has – for the most part – stayed true to the old saying, “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it”. this is the exact same story fans experienced a decade ago, with no extra chapters or modes (although it does throw in a speedrun option and the brilliant left behind prequel), which is probably going to be the dealbreaker for some people. the good news is that the last of us still holds up incredibly well. it’s got all the things you’d expect from a top-class adventure game – environmental puzzles, fluid combat, and loads of collectibles – with a genuinely unforgettable story and characters that will stay with you for a lifetime. with all the tragedy surrounding them, it’s joel and ellie’s unlikely friendship that acts as the beating heart of the game; watching them slowly learn to trust each other and find small moments of joy is what makes the misery and horrors of post-apocalyptic america bearable. while i’d always remembered how the original release made me feel, one thing i had forgotten was how scary it was. the last of us may primarily be an action-adventure survival game, but it’s also one of the best horror games i’ve ever played. the tension of having to sneak around a dark room full of clickers is unmatched, and i don’t think there’s a sound more terrifying than the ones these infected humans emit when searching for their next victim. the improved graphics and 3d audio make these scenarios even more thrilling. ultimately, the last of us part 1 remake does what it promises on the box: takes one of the greatest games of all time and somehow makes it even better. the visuals are stunning and the accessibility options mean even more people will now be able to enjoy it. if that’s good enough for you, or you’ve never played the last of us before, then it’s absolutely worth playing. i just wish there was some new content included – or at the very least, a slightly lower cost of entry. the last of us is as brutal, challenging, and enjoyable as it always has been. with hugely improved visuals, small but meaningful gameplay changes, and a great range of accessibility options, this part 1 remake is without a doubt the definitive version for both newcomers and longtime fans.

the answer is simple; you'd be pleasantly surprised. from expressive and subtle facial animations where you can even see characters spit when they raise their voices to gorgeous scenery where nature is starting to take over everything that mankind built up over the centuries; it's a stunning game to take in. i especially enjoy the smooth transitions from cutscenes to gameplay. v1d30chumz 84-222-52-136 the audio is phenomenal, too, with its satisfying gunfire, gruesome infected sounds, top-notch voice acting, and understated score. however, there are some odd audio bugs such as how certain enemies sound like they're right beside you sometimes when they're actually far away. it's like they forgot to add a filter or something. i'm sure this will be patched soon but i figured i'd mention it. the last of us part i is essentially the same game as the original and to be frank, i didn't notice anything exceptionally different gameplay-wise. in fact, you'd have to discriminately play both the original and this simultaneously in order to spot the minor differences that exist. with that in mind, the core gameplay of exploring, solving basic puzzles, and fighting a mix of humans and infected still holds up for the most part. however, one glaring issue that i noticed is how repetitive many of the puzzles and confrontations are. back in 2013, gamers would have been more forgiving due to the at-the-time unique experience but nowadays, i'm actually surprised by how many scenarios are repeated albeit with minor differences. thankfully, the high degree of challenge makes many of the confrontations exhilarating. another aspect of the last of us part i that i enjoy is how rewarding exploration is, especially when you come across stashes of supplements and upgrade materials then proceed to make your favourite firearms even more potent as well as unlock permanent character upgrades. letting your listening skill reach further and reducing weapon sway will make you feel like an unstoppable infected-slaying machine. plus, all of the collectibles are satisfying to unlock and many of them actually flesh out the game world and story. even though it's still a great game, as i played through the last of us part i, i was constantly reminded of how much better of a game the last of us part ii is. most notably, the confrontations in the last of us part ii are mind-blowing when you consider how diverse and tense they are. remember the part where you have to sneak past cult members as they whistle at each other in code? holy hot darn, that was thrilling! how about the fact that enemies call each other by name which makes each kill feel all the more devastating? and don't let me forget to mention the super-frightening rat king. there's nothing like any of these examples in the last of us part i. now, don't get me wrong; i don't expect a remake such as the last of us part i to outdo its sequel in these regards but it definitely makes it feel dated when you compare the 2 games. could they have added more content and mechanics to make the gameplay as exciting as the sequel? probably. i would have also liked to see additional scenes that hint at events in the sequel. that would have helped make the story side of the equation even more fulfilling, especially for long-time players of the series such as myself. finally, on top of its gripping character-driven story campaign where you also get to enjoy the prequel dlc the last of us: left behind, the last of us part i contains a massive amount of extras. i'm not sure if everything was also featured in the last of us remastered but there's a lot. some highlights include an almost 2 hour behind the scenes documentary, photo mode with a ton of options, character and weapon skins, screen and audio filters, cheats, mirror mode, director's commentary, copious amounts of accessibility options, speedrun mode with comprehensive stats, and a gallery with concept art, character models, podcasts, and more. oh, and how could i forget dualsense implementation which makes using firearms and the bow much more immersive? but, alas, no online factions mode. 🥺 playing the last of us part i made me acquire a newfound appreciation for its sequel because even though it's a great game with incredible characters, it actually feels overwhelmingly dated compared to part ii. you have to love those graphics, though; holy heck! sections on this page: graphics, gameplay, vs. the last of us part ii, and extras. you may also be interested in these: deadcraft review, the house of the dead: remake review, tiny tina's wonderlands review, zombie rollerz: pinball heroes review, infernax review, dysmantle review, heaven dust 2 review, dungeon munchies review, traffic jams review, and minecraft dungeons eye of ender locations guide.

57,https://www.siliconera.com/review-the-last-of-us-part-i-is-a-worthy-revisit-to-a-classic/,Siliconera,80," the last of us is back, although, in all honesty, it feels like it never left. in fact, now that i’ve had a chance to play the last of us part i, it feels like this nine-year-old story’s just arrived. naughty dog’s 2013 post-apocalyptic saga comes to the ps5 looking like it was originally developed for that console instead of the one released two generations back. that’s because it has been, effectively. naughty dog trumpets that the game is “rebuilt” for the ps5 (and eventually for the pc), and having played the thing, i believe them. personally, i think so. on looks alone, the last of us part i is a stunningly beautiful game. in a lot of ways, it looks exactly the way i remember the original looking in 2013 on the ps3. where my memory and imagination filled in the gaps in texture resolution or water effects or fancy lighting, naughty dog’s used modern hardware to make it “real”. the result of nearly ten years of new know-how and lessons learned developing every game that came between the last of us and now expresses itself in this reincarnation. the game includes “fidelity” and “performance” graphical presets. i preferred performance mode, as i don’t have the fanciest tv and liked the additional smoothness of a 60fps framerate lock, but even then, part i looked quite grand. even little touches, like the way algae on the water’s surface deforms around a character when they swim or the dense spores choking the air out of infested areas, added to the sense of atmosphere. the same attention to detail’s been given to character performances. whereas the bells and whistles and fancy effects can get lost on you in the midst of gameplay, the cutscenes look top-notch (and indirectly put even more pressure on the upcoming live-action series to excel and stand out). troy baker and ashley johnson are as powerful as ever in the roles of joel and ellie. as far as i can tell, naughty dog didn’t actually re-capture their performances for this remake. instead, they re-did the scenes using the same motion capture data, updating character models and tweaking the end result to be an “enhanced” version of the original scene. lighting, angles, and effects were changed, the better to achieve that “prestige tv” cinematic look they always wanted to go for. even a few character designs were changed, but i honestly didn’t notice the differences until i did a side-by-side comparison against video of the original game. but whether or not ellie looks more or less like a certain real-life hollywood actor or not, the voices and performance capture were what sold the sell the many moments of the last of us nine years ago. now, characters emote more visibly, tears welling up when they’re agitated, skin flushing when they’re mad. the last of us part i renders cutscenes in real-time now, too. this means you can even mess around with them in the game’s extensive photo mode, adding filters and effects, and even adjusting the lighting to get a different vibe. the “prettiness” also extends to some of the game’s heavier elements, particularly when it comes to violence. the last of us part i might have some of the most jarring gore effects i’ve seen since 2002’s soldier of fortune 2. plenty of games have blood and guts, but naughty dog’s devotion (fixation?) on cinematic realism lends a frankly unsettling quality to its battles, one made more unnerving by modern graphical bells and whistles. bullets dismember enemies, while headshots actually deform characters’ skull models, leaving wet-looking chunks and blackening bloodstains all over the aftermath of a gun battle. it’s a small touch, but it was morbidly fascinating to notice that a dead body’s blood pooled and flowed following the contours of the tiled floor. thankfully, more squeamish players can turn that stuff off easily. the story is the same as it’s always been, one of a bad man bonding with a young girl in the most trying circumstances imaginable. there are some powerful moments in this ultimately melancholy tale, and while the novelty of it has worn off after nine years of tiresome discourse, riffs upon riffs (not to mention that the game itself is a riff on fiction like the road et al), and the expanded context of its sequel, the heart of it still beats. the last of us part i is indisputably the definitive version of this story as far as visuals and “immersive” effects go, but when it comes to whether that’s worth the purchase, the answer’s a bit more complicated. from the perspective of pure consumer value, the last of us part i is honestly a tougher sell than it looks. after all, if you own a ps5 and have a ps plus subscription, you’re already entitled to the last of us remastered, free of charge as part of the ps plus collection. it and part i – and by extension, the ps3-era original – are in terms of core content, exactly the same game. same characters, same story, same wrenching plot twists. if you played the original (or remastered) and don’t feel the need to come back to it, a much prettier version of the same story won’t tip the needle in that regard, either. the team at naughty dog reworked the game’s combat and pathfinding ai to behave more realistically, incorporating features and behaviors developed for the sequel. but combat is more than just ai behaviors, and with the map layouts and general encounter design largely being the same as the original, the differences in enemy and ally behavior come across as largely cosmetic. for example, allies will now behave more realistically and do better at hiding from enemies, but you’ll still occasionally see them standing still in the sight of multiple foes and suffering no consequences. after all, no matter how smart their ai is, the game’s designed not to penalize you for failing to escort ellie or sam or any other companion. after all, it would suck if you failed because an enemy managed to flank an npc you had no control over. in this sense, ai and combat design innovations from 2020 and beyond end up constrained by 2013’s level and encounter design. so even though they were much prettier and more atmospheric than before, my least favorite sections of the last of us were the same in 2022 as in 2013. there are also some extra modes that could help change the value proposition of the last of us part i, particularly for the type of fan that’ll revisit the game again and again. optional cosmetics allow players to play dress-up with joel and ellie. a character model viewer, art gallery, and even developer commentary to gain insight when replaying sections. speedrun mode is also available, unlocking in-game timers and recordkeeping. for ps5-specific features, activity cards and game help is fully supported. the activity cards are particularly useful for players trying to earn the platinum trophy, as they track and reveal locations for collectibles, without having to look that stuff up from an outside source. all my snarking about value goes out the window, though, if you happen to have disabilities and find yourself wanting to play the game. the last of us part i is easily one of the most accessible games i’ve ever played. naughty dog took the already accessibility features developed for part ii and built on them to incorporate into part i. screen reader support, navigation and gameplay assistance, awareness indicators, and dozens of other options make the “quality of life” for a potential disabled player much smoother. you can customize the hud, adjust effects for motion sickness and color blindness, and more. these accessibility options even extend to gameplay, allowing you to toggle off things like losing your breath while underwater, adjusting enemy accuracy, and even making stealth more forgiving. you can even set and customize audio cues for combat to make it easier to tell what’s happening if you’re vision-challenged. this also goes for difficulty options as well. separate from the accessibility menu, players can tweak the difficulty to their liking, setting presets for individual qualities of combat. do you like the lethality of combat in the higher difficulties, but hate how miserly these modes are with resources? ask no more, because you can adjust those settings in the menu. for the masochists, the “grounded mode” preset also makes a return, turning off most of the in-game aids like the hud, the “listening mode”, and other seemingly essential survival tools. in grounded, you can even be detected in stealth by enemies that hear you trying to reload your weapon. in short, if you enjoy having a more customizable gameplay experience or need additional options to play smoothly, the last of us part i is the must-play version. whether or not it truly needs to exist, the fact remains: the last of us part i does exist, and it happens to be the best version of an already pretty good game. the additional accessibility options alone justify it for that section of players. meanwhile, those who are interested in experiencing its story when it looks its best, whether as a first-timer or a veteran revisiting an old favorite, should strongly consider playing it. for everyone else, the other versions are available for less. the last of us part i will launch on the ps5 on september 2, 2022. a pc version is also in development but has no release window at this time.

59,https://gamingtrend.com/feature/reviews/the-last-of-us-part-1-review-a-gorgeous-remake-but-is-a-graphical-upgrade-enough/,GamingTrend,80,"a lot has been said about the last of us as a series since part 2 released, and while i won’t get into the unwarranted controversy that game drew, i will say that, without a doubt, tlou: part 2 was one of the best-looking games of last generation. a few years have passed, and the drama had finally died down – until the last of us: part 1 was announced, a current gen remake of the original ps3 game, which itself had been remastered for the ps4, sending fans into a frenzy yet again. “cash grab”, “unnecessary”, “pointless”, were just a few words thrown around by naysayers, while others were legitimately excited for a remake, hoping that some of the advances made for part 2 would find their way to part 1. so, which side was correct? well, it’s a little of both. let me say that i am a huge fan of the last of us. the original blew me away when it was released and i completed the campaign more times than i can count, eventually obtaining the platinum trophy after a grueling grounded playthrough. years later i became obsessed again with the remaster, this time focusing more on the overwhelmingly tense multiplayer rather than the campaign, although i did run through the campaign a few times just to experience the resoundingly well-written story once again. sure, with a few years between playthroughs my rose-colored glasses had faded a bit and i was able to accept that there were a few flaws, namely in movement and combat, but even then, i still respected the game for the sheer experience i had unveiling the story for the first time. now a few more years have passed, along with a sequel that many fans have a very strange love/hate relationship with. gripes about the story aside – part 2 was nearly universally praised for its upgraded combat mechanics, ai, graphics, and level structure. fans had high hopes that the updates implemented in part 2 would make their way into the part 1 remake, but unfortunately, that isn’t quite the case. for those unaware, the last of us is set twenty years after a major virus outbreak, where many humans have either died or been infected with a fungal mutation which turns them into zombie-type creatures. the core gameplay revolves around survival, with players taking the role of joel as he escorts ellie, a 14-year-old girl, to meet up with the fireflies, a militia set on overthrowing government rule and bringing power back to the people. as joel you must scavenge to find items to craft weapons, upgrade your arsenal, and to have enough ammo for a fighting chance at survival all while taking down the infected and the humans you encounter along your journey. the last of us is a well-made game, with tense combat, fantastic dialogue – especially between joel and ellie as they get to know each other – and a 12-to-15-hour campaign. this release also contains fully remade dlc content in the form of left behind, which tells ellie’s story before she met joel and fills in a spot in the main narrative that was previously missing. while a technical marvel and incredibly impressive graphically, the last of us: part 1 remake plays much the same as it always has. the world, animations, and character models have all been improved to match modern standards and as such, this is easily one of the more impressive looking games on the ps5. but where fans clamored for improvements, few were implemented – aside from significantly improved ai. enemies are now far more threatening, actively communicating with each other to flank and outwit joel. i was constantly impressed watching the enemies’ reactions as they faced off with me. they would shout out where i was located, sneak around corners, and even peek around corners to catch a glimpse of my location, then work together to take me down. this led to far more tense and entertaining encounters than on previous releases. thankfully, enemies aren’t the only ones who got ai improvements, as your teammates now provide better help during fights and are much better at hiding from enemies. one of the most significant additions to this release is the slew of accessibility options added in hopes of making part 1 playable for more people than ever before, and those alone may make this release worthwhile. but for someone who already has experienced the last of us on one, or even two previous console generations, the graphics, ai, and technical upgrades may not be enough to warrant a purchase. naturally, this put me at a crossroads when it came to this review. as a huge fan of the series, i want nothing more than for players to experience the story – but as someone who has purchased the game twice before, i wouldn’t be comfortable purchasing it for a third time as it stands. on its own merits, the last of us is what i would consider essential playing for most gamers, and as such this is the best version of the core game available and absolutely worth taking for a spin if you are new to the series, but then there is the fact that this release contains less content than the previous remaster, as it is noticeably missing the multiplayer and multiplayer related dlc. so, do you prefer a well-made single player campaign with upgraded graphics compared to previous gen releases, and if so, are you willing to forgo the multiplayer component? if the answer to either of those questions is “yes”, then this is the version to pick up. if that answer is no, then this is not the release for you. as it stands, i recognize that this release is a significant upgrade in both graphical terms and ai and those two elements being improved may be enough to satisfy many gamers, i am just not one of them. i previously mentioned the accessibility options, and to say that what’s available is impressive is an understatement. there is a near endless choice of accessibility tech to choose from, including pre-set modes dedicated to providing the best possible experience for those with vision, hearing, or motor accessibility issues. of course, despite what mode you choose, you can still further tweak the settings to suit the exact playstyle you require. among these accessibility options are auto pick up, the ability to skip puzzles, navigation and traversal assistance, awareness indicators, cinematic descriptions, enhanced listen mode, lock on aim, auto weapon swap, ledge guard, infinite breath, help with melee combos, the ability to turn off weapon sway, combat vibration cues, invisibility toggle, and more. like in previous releases, this version also contains a host of system settings to toggle, along with unlockable customization options, special features, and modifiers. immediately upon launching the game for the first time you’ll be greeted by an option screen which allows you to toggle screen reader, which enables narration of on-screen text, and you can fiddle with the text and speech language settings. from there you are offered two modes: performance and fidelity. performance mode provides balanced resolution and framerate, which – depending on video output system settings – offers either dynamic 4k or 1440p with 60hz shooting for a target of 60 fps, while fidelity mode favors resolution over frame rate and targets 30 fps with 4k and 30hz. while figuring out which mode is for you the game displays examples of shadows, midtones, and brights to help you make an informed choice. for the record, i played in performance mode with hdr on, and all the review pictures and gameplay videos on our youtube came from that setting as well. i tend to gravitate toward the mode which offers the most balance between settings, in this case performance mode, and during my 15 hours with the game i experienced no issues with frame rate or performance in any manner. subtitles have been given multiple options as well, allowing players to customize their size, color, background color, and whether the name of each speaker is shown. additionally, you can toggle unique colors for each speaker to help better distinguish characters along with a choice to enable an arrow which will point in the direction of the character speaking. audio settings include dynamic ranges which can be toggled between narrow and wider, with wider allowing for more of a volume increase between quiet and loud sounds while narrow provides less of a difference between sounds. there is also an option for mono audio which combines left and right channels. while the unlockables are nice, most – aside from the modifiers – serve mainly as fluff. while fun to unlock and mess with for a few, most don’t actively contribute to the gameplay. ellie and joel have a variety of cosmetics to unlock, including outfits, backpacks, and gun skins with ellie having a far more diverse roster of unlockables than joel, who sticks mainly with new flannel shirts. ellie can sport outfits ranging from what looks to be uma thurman’s yellow jumpsuit from kill bill to t-shirts with many of naughty dog and sony’s major ips on them. additionally, there are around 30 graphical filters to obtain, which can be toggled on and off at will during gameplay to switch up the graphical style of the game. a few of the available filters include 8-bit, noir, watercolor, headache, and pop poster. while neat to check out for a few, the graphical filters serve more as a deterrent to gameplay than anything useful – essentially, they are cool to show off, but too distracting to be used during a full playthrough. modifiers are the only unlockable items which actively contribute to the gameplay. ranging from simply mirroring the world upon death to full blown cheats, modifiers are the most interesting of the unlockables. cheats include infinite ammo, infinite crafting, one shot kills, touch of death, exploding arrows, and more. these can be toggled on and off at will and allow you to make joel a one-man army. it is quite fun to take everything out in one hit while shooting off infinite exploding arrows and just wreaking havoc, especially after the tension of constantly having low supplies and ammo throughout the base game. the documentary grounded is a thorough and well-made look at the creation of the last of us, from the first thoughts of creating a new ip through the game’s official release. the documentary takes time to dive into every aspect of the game’s creation, including casting, the anxiety of the first playthrough, the motion capture performances, crafting the story, and more. it is a resoundingly interesting documentary and worth watching. the other short documentary and podcasts are nice additions as well, providing a bit further depth to the items discussed in grounded. as you progress through the game, you are given the ability to replay any chapter or enemy encounter that you’ve already experienced, or to just re-watch any cutscene. replaying encounters could be especially useful for those hoping to complete a successful permadeath run, as this mode offers an easy way to practice new approaches and determine the most efficient way to tackle a situation while using a minimal number of supplies. while the accessibility options and special features are nice, in the end it is still hard to ignore the fact that at this point we are getting into a remaster of a remaster, and no matter how incredible the base game is the technical prowess involved, with each release it becomes more difficult to recommend a purchase to players that have already experienced the story as by now this is essentially a more expensive version of the ps4 remaster which had more content, namely the superb multiplayer component. that said, i have tried my best to remove my own biases from this review and judge this release on its own merits, not by what i expected. as a game, the last of us: part 1 still deserves a high score after all these years, but i give that score hesitantly, as i am acutely aware that previous releases offer more content and that this release was not created for those who have already played through and enjoyed the game in the past, but rather to welcome in new players or for those who wish to harness the full power of their ps5. while this is the most technically impressive version of the last of us that we will likely ever get, it is anchored down by its previous releases, while simultaneously missing important components those versions had, namely the superb multiplayer. despite some interesting bonus features, new cosmetic items, vastly improved ai, and a few quality-of-life changes, there may not be enough here to justify the purchase for anybody except newcomers. that said, the impressively robust suite of accessibility options is a welcome addition worthy of praise and will hopefully provide an opportunity for a new generation of fans to experience this story. one of the longest running

60,https://www.gamerevolution.com/review/713816-the-last-of-us-part-1-review-ps5-worth-playing-buying,Game Revolution,80," reviewing the last of us part 1 is a tough assignment. the original and the remaster are both critically lauded. gamerevolution gave both of them a 10 out of 10 upon release, and with good reason — logic would dictate that a remake would also get a perfect score. there’s been a lot of debate about whether the last of us part 1 is really worth its asking price. after all, sony is charging full price for a remake of a game that’s been available for $19.99 (or free) for almost a decade that has already received a successful remaster. the big question is whether or not the updated content made enough of an impact to justify the $50 price difference — so, let’s get this out of the way right at the beginning: pricing is this game’s primary flaw. if it’d been released at a lower msrp, or if it had included the last of us 2, i’d say it’s a great way to experience the game that started it all. but this isn’t a simple cash grab. you can tell developer naughty dog put a ton of effort into refining the gameplay and improving the graphics. however, it doesn’t feel like there was a holistic approach to remaking the last of us. instead, it seems different game segments were walled off and improved independently of the others. i always use resident evil 2 (2019) as an example of a remake done right. capcom looked at every facet of the original and looked at how it could expand that story with modern tools. what we got was faithful to the original but wasn’t afraid to do its own thing. in contrast, the last of us part 1 seems stuck somewhere between remaster and remake; it comes so soon after the release of the 2014 ps4 remaster that a vast improvement isn’t possible. so, while things like dualsense compatibility and improved graphics are welcome, not enough time has passed for it to have that “wow” factor we see with other remakes. storywise, the last of us part 1 is a 1:1 remake of the original. i didn’t play the two side-by-side, but i’m familiar enough with the source material to notice any noteworthy additions or changes to the narrative. you have access to both the base story and its dlc left behind, and you’d be hard-pressed to find something as minor as an adjusted camera angle in a cutscene. while i’m happy the story remains intact, there were some huge missed opportunities here. for example, it would have been nice to see the beginning expanded to show us more of the boston quarantine zone and joel’s smuggling career with tess. alternatively, there are some considerable gaps in joel and ellie’s trip west that naughty dog could have expanded upon. are we supposed to believe that nothing happened to them in the 1,800 miles between pittsburgh, pa, and jackson, wy, after the eventful trip through the northeast? a remake is an excellent time for developers to go back and add or tweak aspects of the story they didn’t have the time, resources, or tech to do the first time. it’d be one thing if this were a $30-40 title, but the lack of new content makes $70 a big ask. with all that said, the story hasn’t aged a bit. it’s still a fantastic journey, and i enjoyed every minute of it. on the flip side, everything but the story has been overhauled for the last of us part 1. pretty much every system has been brought up to the level of the last of us part 2. combat, animations, graphics, visual effects, and sound are all improved over the original. there are no longer any scripted fights with human enemies. instead, when you’re forced to face off against a group of them, the ai will use tactics like pairing up to attack or flanking you, which makes things a lot tougher than they were in the original. your partners’ ai is also improved. there are fewer instances of them awkwardly popping out from cover in front of an enemy only to go unnoticed. of course, it still happens sometimes, but it’s not nearly as immersion-breaking as it was in the original. the updated animation system is also excellent; players and npcs now move through the environment more realistically. for example, they’ll automatically put their hand against a wall if sneaking near one, and they’ll sway their bodies to actively avoid obstacles. all this adds up to make for a more believable environment. but while the action may have had some notable additions, there’s one glaring omission from this package — the original’s factions multiplayer. naughty dog is still working on a standalone version of factions, so it’s likely that naughty dog saw reason to remake the original. however, this brings us back to the price — despite all the gameplay improvements, you’re paying $70 to get less content than was available in the last of us remastered when it launched at $50. sure, a smattering of new extras is included with the last of us part 1, like a model viewer and extra outfits. however, they don’t come close to making up for the loss of factions, and while it’s understandable that naughty dog wouldn’t want to encroach on the standalone version, it makes this a less attractive purchase. the last of us part 1 is the definitive way to experience the original story and left behind. however, it’s hard to recommend it over the ps4 remaster. i appreciate all the work that went into enhancing the visual and audio fidelity and gameplay. however, it’s just not $50 worth of improvement, and the lack of new content means you’re not missing out too much if you decide to go cheaper.

61,https://www.gamesradar.com/the-last-of-us-part-1-ps5-review/,GamesRadar+,80," a remake of exceptional craftsmanship and creative restraint, the last of us part 1's aim may not be as lofty as other games of its kind, but naughty dog lands its mark with one of the most impressive graphical enhancements the medium has seen to date. the danger of having an opening as memorable as the last of us' first 15 minutes is that, nine years later, everyone already knows what to expect. the birthday present, the wake-up call, the desperate drive into town… it's all very much charted territory at this point. and yet, by some magic, that reliable crutch of familiarity is gone in the last of us part 1 on ps5, yanked away by the breathtaking detail that refashions every frame, leaving you as vulnerable to the sequence's raw deluge of emotions as you were when playing it for the very first time. the hysteria of societal breakdown heaves under the weight of an atmosphere rendered more oppressive by cutting-edge lighting and physics. the horror of the newly infected’s screams, a gargled cocktail of rabid rage and abject fear, is heightened thanks to 3d audio that pinpoints their location with terrifying accuracy. and then there's the opening's final moments, where the anguish of a father's grief is more palpable than ever – the previously hidden nuances of troy baker's performance brought to the fore by part 1's hyperreal facial animation. the last of us part 1 has had a hard time justifying its existence in the run-up to release. certainly, even as someone who usually takes any excuse to replay the last of us for the umpteenth time, and has now seen this remake through to the end credits, i'm not going to try and convince you that naughty dog's latest offering is necessarily worth its brow-raising asking price. and yet, despite itself, there's treasure to be unearthed in the last of us part 1, even if it doesn't quite reach the same pedigree of naughty dog's previous work. this remake might not be the most compelling of sales propositions for ps5 owners, then, but it is nonetheless a fascinating case study for the power that technology can have in elevating the impact of interactive storytelling. once a self-explanatory label, the video game remake now resembles a broad church of competing ideas and approaches, encompassing everything from simple restorations to revisionist overhauls. naturally, this evolution has given rise to a steady stream of contentious questions surrounding the genre's very identity. how long is an appropriate amount of time before a game should be remade? where do you draw the line between modernising antiquated mechanics and tampering with an experience's very identity? and as remastering technology continues to evolve – able to effortlessly boost frame rates, resolutions, and plenty more – is there even a future where remakes need to exist? ever the poster child for heated video game debate, the last of us has turned the salience of these questions up to 11 with the release of part 1, asking ps5 players to invest $70/£60 in a largely by-the-book remake that brings naughty dog's survival horror masterpiece more aesthetically in line with its own 2020 sequel. with that price tag, many may have expected an all-inclusive reimagining of the last of us, which itself had already been remastered for ps4 in 2014, but naughty dog has instead opted to focus on an almost exclusively cosmetic update at the expense of any deep, systemic overhauls. that does mean, at least, that when it comes to visual facelifts, the last of us part 1 is pulling no punches. environments look like they've been dip-dyed in lashings of new-gen varnish, offering fresh details to take in and immersive auras to soak up. npcs who appear for barely a few seconds look more detailed and expressive than joel or ellie ever possibly could have on the ps3. updated character models are able to give a more authentic representation of the original performances from naughty dog's mo-cap stage, revealing previously hidden, understated body language and facial expressions that enrich the subtext of key moments across the story. not a single asset has been ignored from naughty dog's attentive treatment, in fact, and the results are phenomenal – not just in comparison to the original game, but to more contemporary exclusives across the entire spectrum of the ps5 catalogue. granted, there's the odd moment where the last of us part 1's identity as a seventh-generation title disguised in the garb of new-gen tech spills clumsily onto the screen (particularly in cutscenes, where awkward animation betrays the authenticity of supremely detailed character models) but, for the most part, this is an incredibly accomplished visual refurbishment. for better and worse, the last of us part 1 is a remake where what you see is pretty much what you get. this isn't to say that no tweaks have been made beneath the game's shiny surface, but their impact upon the player experience isn't as groundbreaking as one might hope; resulting in steadier, smoother, and more accessible play, certainly, but nothing beyond the sum of its additive, commonsense iterations. naughty dog has spoken about much about the updates to part 1's ai programming, for example, building it off of the basis of the last of us 2's ultra intelligent npcs. yet, aside from companions now behaving more sensibly during stealth scenes (ellie finally seems to understand that running out of cover right in front of an enemy patrol probably isn't the smartest idea), i never felt like a combat sequence played drastically different to how i remember. i've no doubt that foes fight harder and smarter than they used to, but i'd be lying if i said it felt as though their new behaviour made for any significantly game changing shake-ups to the last of us' already exhilarating combat. there are a few extra pieces of content, too, including new costumes for joel and ellie, viewable diorama models to be unlocked, and special modes such as permadeath and speedrunning, but these aren't so much essential features of a remake as they are addendums that could have been patched into the original game a long time ago. ps5 specific features, including use of the dualsense's haptic feedback and adaptive triggers, are a more welcome addition, at least, as is the option to select between a performance or fidelity graphics mode that prioritises framerate or resolution quality respectively. and while there are a handful of creative flourishes here and there, including some appreciated efforts to make the last of us part 1 and part 2 feel like a more cohesive whole, this is nonetheless a beat-for-beat retelling of the same story. it's a shame, especially when other studios like capcom are exemplifying the way in which remakes can be an opportunity to remix a much-loved tale for audiences new and old. still, perhaps there's just as much value in being able to infer new readings from a well-known story thanks to technology that has finally caught up with its creator's original vision. a somewhat self-indulgent hypothesis on naughty dog's part, to be sure, but when you're marvelling at the last of us part 1's cutscenes in all their lavish glory, it's one that's difficult to argue against. the last of us part 1 is, perhaps more than anything, a gorgeous visual love letter to its biggest fans, not to mention a welcoming set of open arms for the inevitable stream of new ones who will arrive to the game via the upcoming last of us tv show from hbo next year. judged in isolation, that's far from a bad thing. but in the context of an industry where remakes are continuing to push the boundaries of the art of restoration, part 1 struggles to escape the shadow of feeling like a bit of a missed opportunity. still, one of the most polished and best looking missed opportunities of the current generation is hardly an unappetising prospect for ps5 owners, especially when platform exclusives remain frustratingly rare this far into the console's lifecycle. the question you have to ask yourself before picking up part 1, then, is not only whether a feast for the eyes is a meal worth paying for, but whether that meal is going to completely satisfy your appetite, particularly if you've already had your fill of the original recipe. the last of us part 1 patch fixes issues with photo mode and accessibility the last of us part 1 players are enjoying this subtle but cool new feature ",8408
62,https://hardcoregamer.com/reviews/review-the-last-of-us-part-i/426886/,Hardcore Gamer,80," it’s difficult to imagine the gaming industry without the last of us. naughty dog’s ps3 swan song left such an impression back in 2013 that players still talk about its characters and the ending to this day. the game also propelled playstation studios along the narrative track, paving the way for hit narrative-based titles like god of war (2018), marvel’s spider-man, ghost of tsushima, and horizon zero dawn, among others. a sequel, the last of us part ii, arrived in 2020 with numerous improvements to the original’s formula, though the original remains held in high regard. despite being easily playable in its remastered form via backwards compatibility on ps5, naughty dog has opted to remake the original 2013 title into what they view as the’ definitive’ version of the last of us. now dubbed the last of us part i, does this remake capture the original’s magic to justify its premium price tag or should it be thrown into a batch of clickers? the last of us part i is a one-to-one remake of the original 2013 title with most of the last of us remastered’s content and quality-of-life improvements attached. boiled down to its fundamental core, you’re getting the original campaign, the left behind dlc, some of the last of us part ii’s quality-of-life improvements and ui changes, as well as a complete visual overhaul. the last of us part i takes place in 2033, twenty years after an outbreak transforms a significant portion of humanity into aggressive monsters called the infected. humanity lives in remote pockets, resorting to violence for survival. you play as joel, a survivor forced into a hopeless world. that all changes when he meets ellie, a young girl supposedly immune to the infection. forced together out of circumstance, joel must escort ellie across the country in search of the fireflies, the best last hope of finding a cure and ending this deadly plague. back in 2013, the last of us was a masterclass in videogame storytelling, and though nine years have passed, the story remains just as thrilling and engaging as ever. the last of us part i successfully recaptures that feeling of humanity the original title was able to illicit. joel and ellie’s growing relationship remains at the story’s emotional center, with side characters serving as both positive and negative foils. all these years later, troy baker and ashley johnson’s performances remain as riveting as ever, successfully giving life and emotions to their characters. the last of us part i’s story might be another zombie apocalypse story, but the characters, performances and writing continue to elevate this story above its peers. nestled amongst the story is the left behind dlc, which remains a separate item and not integrated into the main campaign — serving as both a prequel and interquel. left behind focuses on ellie before she’s infected as well as filling in the gaps between the fall and winter chapters of the main game. though short, left behind masterfully builds up ellie’s character, and in hindsight, helps set up her character wonderfully for the last of us part ii. as good as the last of us part i’s story is nine years on, the simple fact is that this is a nine-year-old story that has been widely and readily available on ps4 and currently on ps5 (via backwards compatibility) for the majority of that time. so if you’ve already played the last of us, you know exactly what you’re getting storywise. it’s faithful to the original material, but the remake doesn’t provide a compelling reason to return unless you’re dying to relive the narrative or don’t have access to the remastered edition available in the ps+ extra library. the faithfulness of the remake trickles down into the core design and gameplay systems. simply put, if you’ve played the last of us remastered, you should know what to expect. like the original, the last of us part i is divided into separate chapters with players guiding joel and ellie through murderous humans and creepy infected. the game remains a third-person shooter survival title, with players deciding how to engage with enemies. stealth and all-out-assaults, or mixing in elements of both, are viable options in the last of us part i. combat arenas are generally spacious and cater well to the different playstyles of the last of us. don’t expect to go prone or use different elevations to get the jump on enemies like in the last of us part ii. all weapons, equipment and available strategies are carried over from the original release. that isn’t to say that part ii’s influences aren’t felt elsewhere in part i. the menu ui and weapon upgrade animations have received upgrades more in line with part ii. the partner ai and enemy ai have also been given updates and tweaks, though wonkiness remains, including partners not following the right pathing and ruining stealth attempts. the enemy ai is improved and adds a level of variety and intensity to gunfights not present in older versions. unlike the original, enemies in part i will actively try and find ways to flank you, similar to part ii. combat in part i ends up being far more dynamic for these changes, and though it never reaches the same highs as part ii’s combat, it is a noticeable improvement over remastered. perhaps the best quality-of-life improvement to carry over from part ii is the accessibility options. the last of us part i allows players to tinker and tailor the experience to ensure the game is playable for as many as possible. these were terrific options in part ii and it’s fantastic to see naughty dog’s commitment to enabling gaming for everyone. outside of those under-the-hood changes and dualsense features, the last of us part i has no other updates or changes to the core design or gameplay. these updates bring it close to part ii’s experience without significant alterations. still, one major omission stops this remake from being the definitive version of the last of us, which is of course the removal of the fan-favorite multiplayer mode, factions. while naughty dog is developing a standalone factions experience, losing the mode in part i and offering nothing to replace it is disappointing. its loss ultimately makes it difficult to claim this is the definitive version when the last of us remastered remains more content complete. so far, there’s not much that the last of us part i does significantly better than the last of us remastered. while the ai, ui, and accessibility improvements are outstanding, the core game remains the same except for losing factions. the presentation, however, does change that for the better. the last of us part i’s visuals have been completely overhauled. while the bones of the last of us remain intact, textures, models and special effects have either been updated or completely remade to take advantage of the ps5. everything in the game, from building facades to raging fires to character models, has been rebuilt with additional details. while it may not impress as much as an older title remade for ps5 like demon’s souls or a built-from-the-ground-up ps5 title like ratchet & clank: rift apart, the results are still mighty impressive, particularly when sitting the game side-by-side with the last of us remastered. the result is a highly immersive, though still familiar, experience. the remainder of the presentation remains intact. gustavo santaolalla’s fantastic soundtrack sounds as good as ever. meanwhile, the performances of each cast member remain as impeccable as they did in 2013 with improved facial and in-game animations adding additional layers to their performances. the last of us part i’s presentation is a massive facelift, and though it can’t change the fact that what you see and hear isn’t anything new, it looks at least remarkable. remaking the last of us was always going to be a tricky prospect due to how little time has passed since its original 2013 release. go too hard on a reimagining like resident evil 2/3 and naughty dog would risk alienating fans of the original. go too little on changes or new story content, and the studio would risk the project being called a cash grab. with the last of us part i, naughty dog opted to create the ‘definitive’ experience by staying as faithful as possible while incorporating some elements of the last of us part ii. the result is an impressive-looking facelift that exceeds the visuals of part ii, but doesn’t offer much new beyond graphics. complicating the picture is that the last of us remastered is still readily available physically and digitally for a low price, or as part of the ps+ extra library. the ai, ui and accessibility options are welcome quality-of-life improvements, but remastered’s continued playability alongside 4k and 60fps options showcase that they aren’t the end-all-be-all. don’t be mistaken: the last of us part i remains the same excellent game that engrossed millions of players back in 2013. the story, performances and artistic vision remain impeccable and among the best in the industry. even the gameplay and design, which part ii outclassed, remain fun and engaging despite showing some age. the last of us part i’s real problem is that the last of us remastered exists and doesn’t provide a substantial reason to choose it over remastered given its pricing and missing content. the last of us remains a timeless classic, but the last of us part i isn’t quite the must-have definitive version of the title.

63,https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/the-last-of-us-part-i,Push Square,80," the last of us: part i feels like how you remember naughty dog’s critically acclaimed 2013 survival horror, which is both a blessing and a bit of a curse. in many ways, this ps5 re-release blurs the lines between remake and remaster, overhauling the original in almost all areas, without tinkering with what made it so great. it means that not all of the improvements will be immediately obvious to the casual observer, but compared side-by-side with the ps3 edition and its ps4 remaster, this is undoubtedly the best version of a contemporary classic. the californian studio says the 15-hour campaign and its heart-warming left behind expansion have been rebuilt from the ground-up, but it’s important to contextualise what this means. the level design, save for a few minor alterations, is identical. some interiors have been redesigned and collectibles repositioned to add more logic to the world building, but by-and-large this is an indistinguishable adventure – even down to the placement of enemies and the numbers in their ranks. this doesn’t mean naughty dog is lying, however. the gameplay is vastly superior to the original release, with much of the motion-matching technology introduced in the last of us 2 integrated here. it means that there’s more freedom overall, as protagonist joel will seamlessly transition between animations rather than stopping-and-starting like he did in the original: throwing a bottle, sprinting forward for a melee attack, and then popping off a shot looks flawless now. despite this, the combat does not hit the same heights as its successor. rather than redesign gauntlets, the developer has decided to keep combat encounters the same, meaning the dodge and prone mechanics that made the skirmishes so pulsating in the sequel are missing. fights also feel much “smaller” in scope, owing to the limitations enforced by the original ps3 design, and therefore the last of us 2 is still very much the pinnacle of third-person shooters as far as we’re concerned. these same constraints apply to the level design, which feels restricted a decade later. while the game certainly has its moments of freedom, the sequel was a much larger endeavour overall, allowing you to explore off the beaten path. the last of us: part i’s reduced scope feels dated in comparison, with piles of debris and conveniently placed fences inexplicably locking you to a set path. it’s clear this is not how the game would be designed today. but the artificial intelligence is much smarter at least. you’ll no longer brush against immersion breaking scenarios, like ellie running directly in front of the line of sight of enemies, as everyone is much brighter overall. aggressors will collaborate and communicate, calling out your position and working to find flanking positions – even on lower difficulties. it makes the combat that much more gratifying, and comparing it to the original is eye-opening to say the least. the same is true of the extraordinary art direction overhauls. naughty dog has made the game less grim than its muddy and macabre predecessor, and some locations like the capitol building are unrecognisable in a good way. the sheer amount of detail invested into every single frame is phenomenal, comfortably putting the remake among the best-looking ps5 titles to date. all of the locations feel lived in; there’s clear thought been put into how assets are organised, meaning the environments themselves have their own stories to tell. special mention must also be attributed to the sound, which leverages the ps5’s nifty tempest chip to create some of the best 3d audio to date. sony’s first-party releases tend to have tremendous mixing across the board, but the last of us 2 was a watershed moment for the platform holder in terms of sound design, and this remake matches up. with a quality pair of cans, you can pinpoint the position of enemies purely from their footsteps, and we actually found we didn’t need to rely on the title’s detective vision-style listen mode anywhere near as much as in previous versions. and that’s without even speaking of the animations, which have been dramatically reworked. cutscenes now run in realtime on the ps5, and are not pre-rendered like they were originally. this means that the transitions between gameplay and cinematics are less abrupt, and more importantly there’s a consistency to the character models throughout. many of the most important scenes, like the heart-breaking prologue, have an intensity that simply didn’t exist in the original. naughty dog’s efforts with the dualsense should not go unnoticed either. the developer has created unique textures for almost every scenario in the game, meaning you’ll feel the rattle of shrapnel as you craft a nail bomb or the pitter-patter of rain as you work your way through the drizzly outskirts of boston. it’s some of the best use of the pad’s innovative features since astro’s playroom, and it adds to the overall immersion of both sedate and high-intensity moments. in fact, the developer’s also found ways to innovate on its award-winning accessibility with the pad’s unique features. one specific addition allows you to “feel” speech through haptic feedback, which in conjunction with the subtitles will allow deaf players to physically appreciate the way lines are delivered. there’s also full audio commentary for every cinematic in the game, taking the outfit’s commitment to accessibility to an unprecedented level. and for returning players, there’s a lot of bonus content to unlock and explore. there are artwork galleries for both the original release and its remake, and a wealth of new skins for joel and ellie have been added, many of which are inspired by popular playstation properties. for those looking for some replay value, there’s a new speedrun mode, which has been integrated into the ps5’s activity cards, and you can even sort through your records and best times on a chapter-by-chapter basis. that said, the original’s unexpectedly popular multiplayer mode has been cut, and this isn’t a cheap proposition overall. even with all of the improvements outlined above, £69.99/$69.99 is a tough to pill to swallow at launch, and while it’s clear an impressive amount of work has been invested into this remake, we’re yet to be convinced it justifies its eye-watering release day price point. make no mistake, though, the campaign stands up to modern scrutiny. without reference to the original, it’s not always easy to appreciate the last of us: part i’s impressive improvements. this is a much better game than the original, though, with stronger art direction, smoother gameplay, and much more emotional cinematics. naughty dog has done justice to the original by improving on it in almost every regard, but it remains the game you remember from 2013. at a more competitive price point, it’d be essential – as it is, it’s a pricey upgrade on a bona fide classic. i've spent a lot of time on the last of us: part i this week, so any questions please feel free to ask. i'll do my best to answer them all over the coming days leading up to launch! the first couple of paragraphs told me everything i needed to know and as suspected it's technically the best version of the game without really being any different. something i may pick up down the line in a sale as i've effectively already played this several times. for anyone new to it, this sounds like the way to play it and to anyone else picking it up i hope you enjoy it sounds like pretty much what i thought it would be. it's a shame they didn't recreate combat encounters to modernise the whole thing. i'll probably skip this one for now. will probably grab it a few years down the line if they ever heavily discount it, but at £70 it's a hard no. or not. i might try this game again sometime in the future. 5$ sounds right.",7845
64,https://wegotthiscovered.com/gaming/review-the-last-of-us-part-i-successfully-revives-an-aging-masterpiece/,We Got This Covered,80," the last of us part i is far from a wholly necessary experience, but it's a well-crafted and polished one from start to finish. while there hasn’t been a rumor or rumbling about a third main line entry in developer naughty dog’s flagship survival-action series, it’s quite clear that it won’t be going away any time soon. after years of failed live-action developments, things seem to have gotten things back on track with an upcoming tv adaptation set to premiere next year on hbo. and while it’s by no means a proper sequel, a standalone multiplayer game is currently being worked on, and this reviewer can only hope that it won’t follow in the footsteps of the many ill-fated live service titles that have come before it. but for those itching for a more traditional single-player experience, there’s the last of us part i, a from-the-ground-up remake of the 2013 original built to take advantage of all the tech crammed into the playstation 5. i wouldn’t blame you if you read that last line with a healthy dose of skepticism, seeing as how this is the second time sony and naughty dog have sought fit to re-release the last of us at full price. admittedly, i raised an eyebrow myself when it was revealed a couple of months back, but after going hands-on with it for myself, i can safely say that it’s an amazing package and experience — but not one that’s for everyone. instead of diving into what exactly the last of us part i is, let’s go over what it isn’t. while i’d wager that this new version (or “remake,” as it’s being touted as in promotional material) is built off the same (eh, probably improved) tech and engine that powered the last of us part ii, the core gameplay remains intact. in short, don’t expect to use any fancy ropework in order to scale buildings and walls, and you definitely won’t be going full-prone in order to sneak by enemies. joel has the exact same abilities as he did back in the day, so expect a fairly limited set of weapons, and a whole lot of crouch-walking. that being said, the last of us part i isn’t a simple remaster, and that becomes evident a few minutes after jumping into the main story. buildings have more detailed geometry and materials, foliage and grass are noticeably more dense and lush, and the lighting has seen a massive overhaul. for those playing along at home, pay close attention to all the reflections, explosions, and shadow work during the opening sequence when you first take control of joel — you’ll see what i mean. character models have been drastically improved, with more realistic skin and facial rigs. while it looks like animation and mocap data have been reused here (and for good reason, as it would be a bit of a waste to redo all that work), movement as a whole looks more polished thanks to new rigs. there’s a good chance you might not even notice some of these improvements in motion, but having just played through the last of us remastered, they were easy to spot. leading up to release, naughty dog has also been quick to point out that the combat system and enemy ai have been given a complete overhaul, and while i don’t doubt their claims in the slightest, even i have to admit that it’s pretty tough to notice those kinds of behind-the-scenes improvements. that being said, in the original release, one of the more obvious technical shortcomings was the way your ai companions (namely, ellie) would navigate around enemies, often coming ducking and weaving right in front of gun-toting bandits and infected. back then, it stuck out like a sore thumb (since enemies would only react if they spotted the player), but with the last of us part 1, i didn’t notice these slip-ups as often. in terms of gameplay additions, they are few and far between but welcome nonetheless. as expected, gunplay fully taps into the dualsense’s haptic feedback and adaptive triggers, with some weapons making use of trigger resistance — most easily felt with ellie’s bow and joel’s revolver. the award-winning suite of accessibility features that made their debut in the last of us part ii is back in full force, and those who lack a surround sound setup might want to check out the game’s 3d audio. as a self-professed graphics and performance junkie, i was glad to see that the last of us part i has a few options to take advantage of. for those looking to maximize graphical fidelity, a fidelity mode will max out the resolution at 4k by capping the framerate at 30, while the game’s performance mode targets 60 frames per second at a dynamically-scaling 4k. for those rocking tvs and monitors that support 120 hz refresh rates, the aforementioned fidelity mode can be bumped up to 4k at 40 frames per second, which offers a nice middle ground. variable refresh rate (vrr) is supported out of the box, and there’s even an option to unlock the framerate in order to squeeze out as much performance as possible. there’s plenty to like with the last of us part i, though it’s not hard to see why it has its fair share of detractors and critics. and honestly, i think that’s ok. from its initial unveiling, naughty dog and sony have touted this release as the definitive way to experience the landmark original, but not necessarily as a ‘must-play’ for those who’ve already played through joel and ellie’s harrowing adventure. the last of us part i might not be for everyone, but that doesn’t make it any worse. for those who decide to take the plunge (whether it be for the first time or the umpteenth), you’re in for an unforgettable experience. this review is based on the playstation 5 version of the game. a copy was provided to us

65,https://ztgd.com/reviews/last-of-us-part-1-ps5/,ZTGD,80,"the last of us may become the new resident evil 4. sony has set a precedent that we should see a remaster of this game every generation going forward. the game originally launched on the ps3 then got a remaster on ps4 and now a full on remake on ps5. that has to be unprecedented. the only game i can think of that has been ported more in that short of time is likely doom or the aforementioned re4. still the original last of us is one of naughty dog’s best games, yes even better than the second game to me, but to be revisited three times in three generations seems a touch obsessive. say what you want about the original game, but it changed narrative-driven titles and expanded upon the foundation the developers started with uncharted. the game conveyed more emotion than anything else before it. the opening cut scene is still one of the most powerful things i have ever witnessed. even though i have seen it multiple times, it still gets me to this day. with the power of the ps5 it is even more gut-wrenching now. new facial animations showcase the characters feelings and now match the outstanding voice acting even more. it might not look all that different in internet videos, but blaring on my oled tv at 60fps this game is a visual masterpiece. visuals are definitely the biggest change. i cannot stress enough that the videos online simply don’t do it justice. the lighting has been increased ten-fold. the foliage and destructible objects really immersed me into this world, even more so than it originally did on the ps3. the game truly looks stunning. there are also plenty of options as far as resolution and frame rate. i opted for 60fps because games just feel better. thankfully the hit was not as major as it might have been on previous consoles. the amount of detail and visual fidelity was still so high. this is truly a game that makes my oled scream. this game is simply stunning, there is no better word for it. visual fidelity is not the only change though. the game play has been refined to feel even more akin to last of us 2. while still not the best as far as shooting goes, the game feels light years better than the original. so much more control over my shots and movement feels better. naughty dog games have never felt as fluid as i would like. this remake continues to trend upward with more finite handling of everything. i get that some things need to feel realistic to immerse players, but at the same time i want to feel like i am playing a game, not wrestling with controls. this is the best feeling naughty dog game to date and the changes are truly welcomed in this remake. naughty dog continues to be the king of accessibility. last of us part 1 is simply overflowing with options. i felt like i needed a tutorial on all the available switches. this game has difficulty sliders for everything. it has visual and hearing aids that simply make the game more accessible to just about anyone. one of the coolest features of this is a new dual sense feature that uses nuanced motion to convey the emotion of the person speaking. it is simply incredible. even though i didn’t require it, i left it on for much of the game as it added so much to the experience. this is truly next-gen as far as features go. everything else will make the game truly accessible to anyone. players can customize to their heart’s content at any point in the game. naughty dog is truly head and shoulders above anyone else in this department that it almost feels unfair. every game should strive to be half as good at accessibility as this team has become. the game does boast a couple new modes for players who want the real challenge though. the new permadeath mode is exactly what it says and makes the intensity ramp up to a thousand. knowing that one wrong move will result in starting the entire game over will test even the most trialed gamer. there is also a speedrun mode that tracks progress and allows players to work towards the best time. not a ton of new pieces to the puzzle, but all are welcomed. let’s discuss the elephant in the room though. this game is $70 for a title that has been remastered already. ps5 players likely have played this, not to mention this version strips out the multiplayer making it a lesser package. that is not to say the upgrades are not worth the money. this game has truly been rebuilt, this is not a quick port. the work was done and this could easily be considered a full-price game. it is just a full-priced game most playstation owners have played before. at least once if not more. this makes it a hard pill to swallow with the price increase of playstation games this generation. if you love this series and don’t mind the entry fee, i won’t tell you it isn’t worth it, but it is still something to consider. there is no extra content here, just the core game without the online and a truckload of updated features and quality of life improvements. the last of us part 1 is a hard game to review. on one hand it is still an amazing achievement all these years later. the story is fantastic, and the characters are some of the best. i love the original game and this remake doesn’t change that. still for $70 it is a lot to ask for a game that hasn’t exactly been out of the conversation since it released. the removal of multiplayer is also questionable, but i guess it makes sense as players could still play that in the ps4 remaster. there is a lot to appreciate here, and truly this is one of the best-looking games ever created.

holds up despite some of its dated level design. joel looks different in the last of us part i. it took me a while to notice, but once i did, it was hard to unsee. there's a pain in his eyes. his clothes and features are the same, but there's a quiet, unmistakable torment imprinted on his face. i've played the last of us nearly a dozen times across ps3 and ps4, and i had never seen it worn so plainly. i know joel has a troubled past because the last of us part i goes out of its way to show you a traumatic death in the opening scene, but that pain was never etched into his facial features this clearly. there's an argument to be made that the last of us part i is too similar to the ps3 and ps4 versions to be considered a remake, and part of me agrees with that sentiment. the story is identical, the level design is exactly the same, and the gameplay--apart from some quality-of-life improvements--is unchanged. on paper, if you've played the last of us and remember it well, there's little reason to return to it on ps5. but the last of us part i is more than the sum of its parts. it's an unrelenting tour de force that strategically leverages the power of the playstation 5 to push its story and themes a little further. slight though many of them may be, all its enhancements serve the story, and the story is just as good as it was nine years ago. the most obvious way the last of us part i does this is with its visuals. the overhauled lighting, sharp new textures, and smoother animations make the last of us a prettier game, but it's the details in the faces and characters that make it a more meaningful one. i can feel the repressed pain in joel, sense the pervasive hope in marlene, and glimpse fleeting moments of innocence in ellie. these details may not alter the way you think about these characters, but they certainly add more depth to them. admittedly, these are also details that i've internalized through my multiple playthroughs, years of thinking about the game, and hours of consuming analysis of it. but the intricacies in the way characters are now depicted mean that, for newcomers in particular, the nuances are more immediately perceptible. the writing and acting remain as strong as ever, and although none of the changes recontextualize characters or events, delicate retouches give them greater gravitas. what does recontextualize the characters is the existence of the last of us part ii. joel's actions are harder to stomach knowing their eventual consequences, and ellie's bloody quest for revenge in the sequel makes her character arc in part i all the more tragic. even if you didn't like the direction the narrative took in part ii, it makes the final moments of the last of us part i tougher to swallow. what's more interesting is that, despite knowing how things would eventually shake out, i rarely questioned joel's motives throughout the game, even in those final moments. it's a testament to naughty dog's superb storytelling and fantastic characters that--despite knowing full well what joel's actions entailed--i wanted to protect ellie at all costs. all those complicated feelings the last of us left me with nine years ago came back stronger when i wrapped up part i. the gameplay improvements, although subtle, are also done in service of the story. aiming is more responsive, weapons have a satisfying heft to them, and joel is a bit easier to maneuver. he's not as nimble as ellie is in part ii, but a lot of the rough edges in the original have been smoothed out. this kind of stuff is to be expected in remaster or remake, but in the case of the last of us part i, it removes another barrier from the experience. the tweaks to the combat and gameplay give joel a more cohesive characterization on screen. it may seem like reading a bit too much into it but think of the times you've clumsily missed your gunshots because of the way the aiming works and how that undermined a character we're told has been fighting to survive in a hellish post-apocalypse for 20 years--he shouldn't be whiffing shots in matters of life and death. with the tweaks, the last of us part i's joel feels more like a cold and calculated combatant. he is as ruthless as you'd expect from someone in his position and with his tragic history. the improved ai, meanwhile, brings with it a greater sense of peril, especially on the tougher difficulties. enemies are more aggressive and employ advanced tactics. some will pressure you from afar while others will flank you if you aren't paying attention. every now and then an enemy will wait for you to approach and go for an ambush. the unpredictable ai makes for some harrowing firefights. success demands a mixture of forethought, improvisation, and skill. what really makes the ai so effective is its tenacity. enemies will fight tooth and nail to survive. if you take an enemy hostage, they will try to bargain with you. others in the vicinity will try to talk you down before taking action. if you hold a hostage for too long, they will struggle free and return fire. the enemies you come across don't just feel like an obstacle you have to overcome. they feel like people desperately trying to survive in a world that has been torn apart. it helps that companion ai is much better, too. in the original, ellie, tess, and bill would frequently end up in places they shouldn't have been. they couldn't alert enemies, but it was always jarring to see ellie run in front of an infected while looking for cover. occasionally in part i, a companion did get in my way in some tighter areas, but i haven't seen anyone carelessly wander into the fray in this new version. it's a small fix but, once again, it makes this world feel more authentic. where the last of us part i shows its age is in its level design. just like the original nine years ago, the game often relies on pallets, dumpsters, and ladders for its traversal puzzles. the last of us part i takes place over the course of a year, and joel never takes the time to teach ellie to swim. this means that every time you encounter deep water you need to find a conveniently placed pallet to ferry her across a small body of water. it was hard to overlook back then, but it's even harder to overlook now. naughty dog has gone through great pains to immerse the player in the world, and these simple puzzles don't fit the tone of the game. they are rote video game moments in an experience that doesn’t need them. the last of us part i is an unrelenting tour de force that strategically leverages the power of the playstation 5 to push its story and themes a little further. slight though many of them may be, all its enhancements serve the story, and the story is just as good as it was nine years ago the combat arenas also feel a bit too enclosed and straightforward. there are some standouts, like the docks at the beginning of the game or the bookstore in philadelphia, but most of the encounters take place in linear corridors with waist-high objects used as cover. this lack of freedom limits your options in combat and makes it difficult to improvise when your back is up against a wall. it's a shame because joel's arsenal is varied, and his craftable items can be fun to use. it's even harder to overlook given how impressive part ii's level design was. the reason why combat felt so dynamic in part ii was because there was always room to improvise and multiple avenues of approach to support this. this is unmistakably one of those moments where the limited scope of this ""remake"" undermines the idea of creating harmony between the first and second parts of the last of us' overall story. while the narrative and characterization certainly feel more cohesive now, the same can't be said for how it feels to play the two games. the biggest example of this is joel's inability to go prone. it may have seemed like a minor mechanic in the last of us part ii, but it fundamentally changed the way i approached combat. obviously, part i was not designed with a crawling joel in mind. there is no grass to hide in, and cover is almost always waist-high, but the inability to go prone does create more of a dissonance between part i and part ii. however, fixating on gameplay discrepancies between both games diminishes the last of us part i's achievements. the brilliantly-paced narrative is supported by some of the finest environmental storytelling in the business. so much of the world and its inhabitants can be extracted from the smallest details. a throwaway line between two hostile enemy npcs can shed light on other parts of the world, while a simple message scrawled across a wall hints at how the outbreak was handled two decades ago. the environments are rich with details that add flavor to joel and ellie's journey. the most welcome addition to the last of us part i is its impressive suite of accessibility features. like the last of us part ii, there are a wide range of visual, auditory, and difficulty settings that significantly lower the bar to entry and make the experience more accommodating. you can customize subtitles, tweak screenshake, enable different vision modes, and retool the controls at any time to fit your needs. even if you don't think you need any of these features, you might find something in there to make your experience a little smoother. i frequently played with high-contrast mode enabled to help me track down smaller collectibles that i wouldn't normally be able to see, but for others, these newly added options might make what was previously an unplayable game into a playable one. additionally, the last of us part i adds a ton of new unlockables in the extras menu. like in previous naughty dog games, as you play through the story you accrue points that can be used to unlock all sorts of things. there's concept art from both the original and remake, new and returning character skins, gameplay modifiers like infinite ammo and explosive arrows, and a handful of behind-the-scenes videos and podcasts. while none of this fundamentally changes the experience, i spent hours digging through this menu to admire all the intricately designed character models and test out the new gameplay modifiers. these bells and whistles do a good job of rounding out the package. the most painful omission from this remake is factions, the stellar pvp mode from the original game. the multiplayer mode had players choose a faction and build out a camp of survivors by running supply raids, which were matches that pitted you against the rival faction. success would earn you resources to keep your compound afloat. naughty dog is working on an expanded standalone multiplayer component set in the world of the last of us and its sequel, but it's a shame the original factions mode didn't make the cut. those looking for a little longevity from the game can instead try the speedrun and permadeath modes. the permadeath mode in particular fits nicely with the themes of the last of us. it's not for the faint of heart, even on easier difficulties, but it significantly ups the stakes. every encounter must be tackled with precision, and a wasted bullet could lead to an untimely death. the speedrun mode on the other hand feels at odds with what the last of us accomplishes with its story. the thoughtful pace and quiet moments are undone by a timer and a scoring system. it's not necessarily a bad inclusion, and it's available as an option, but it's definitely not the way i'd like to experience the last of us part i. all these improvements taken by themselves may seem minor, but together they make one of the most memorable games of the ps3 era even better. in some ways, the two parts of the last of us are now better aligned, making transitioning between them much smoother. however, in other ways, the years of progress in game design and development are all too apparent. but while some of the level design may not have aged all that well, the vivid cast of characters and remarkable story are more poignant than ever.

69,https://www.gameskinny.com/4ysv5/the-last-of-us-part-1-review-the-last-time-for-the-third-time,GameSkinny,70,"the last of us is considered by many to be a modern masterpiece of storytelling in video games. it garnered widespread acclaim when it was released in 2013 and was a significant early title in establishing sony's lineup of prestige first-party titles. after playing through its remake in the last of us part 1, i'm left with one unanswered question: why does this version of the game exist? developer naughty dog bills the last of us part 1 (tlou part 1) as a remake, not a remaster. that version released in 2014. the graphics here are fully rebuilt, while the gameplay and story are true to the original. on paper, it's a winning concept. who doesn't want to revisit a near-consensus masterpiece in the best possible way? the graphical enhancements touted by naughty dog aren't just lip service. tlou part 1 is stunning; it's one of the best-looking console games i've ever seen. the character models are incredibly lifelike, which brings the already-excellent performances to life. the new lighting system casts detailed shadows, and the chromatic effect of rainbows at the center of a flashlight beam looks authentic. that said, some drawbacks come with that new graphical fidelity. everyday objects that form crafting components blend too well with their surroundings, making them a chore to locate. there's no telling which desk drawers can be opened and searched, so keeping stocked supplies often involves combing the perimeter of every object in the room. areas that were dark and atmospheric in the original are pitch black in this version, save for the area illuminated by the flashlight. basic navigation is a chore more than before. these aesthetic tweaks make tlou part 1 look amazing but harder to play. the story is as great as ever, every bit as poignant, exhilarating, and painful as before. the natural range of emotion and expression in joel, ellie, and the extended cast has lost none of its power and is as masterfully executed today as in 2013. it doesn't deviate in any way — which is fine — but perhaps tlou part 1 is a missed opportunity to add additional depth or recontextualize things like final fantasy 7 remake did. what hasn't aged as well is the actual gameplay. unlike resident evil remake or final fantasy 7 remake, the way tlou part 1 plays hasn't been adjusted — and that's a problem. what was once passable stealth gameplay wrapped in subpar shooting mechanics becomes bad stealth gameplay wrapped in awful shooting by today's standards. take the simple act of sneaking around human enemies as an example. you can dispatch enemies silently, but there's no way to move or hide the bodies. joel just leaves them in the middle of the floor for anyone to stumble across. if you are spotted, everyone in the area immediately knows where you are, as if they have a hive mind — even if you eliminate the enemy that discovered you before they make a sound or raise the alarm. the shooting, meanwhile, is slow, clunky, and wildly imprecise. that could make the game difficult if the enemy ai wasn't atrocious. often, the fastest way to get from one area to the next is to hold a doorway and shoot the enemies as they file in one at a time, joining the growing pile of bodies at your feet. mix in some quick time events, and tlou part 1 plays like a mediocre game from the mid-2000s. that's not to say all the improvements made to tlou part 1 are purely superficial. the brilliant suite of accessibility features that debuted in the last of us part 2 have been brought over here. this, even more so than the improved visual quality, is tlou part 1's greatest achievement. there are deeply customizable alternate controls, visual aids, and many different options to help with some of the different ways people process visual information. you can skip puzzles, tweak combat, and enable cinematic descriptions. there's a care and thoughtfulness to it all that is readily apparent, and it's the sort of feature-set that every game should endeavor to emulate and improve upon. that doesn't mean tlou part 1 dials down the violence and somber atmosphere. it's still a mature title, with frightening monsters and a bleak world. the clickers and bloaters are more terrifying than ever, especially in 4k resolution with hdr and some great headphones. i've played this game multiple times in its various iterations, and i still took additional breaks to keep my stress levels from boiling over. the shifts between the action, story, and horror segments are well-spaced, with the right amount of time between sequences to keep things fresh. that's what puzzles me the most about this remake. the pacing is great because the pacing was always great. the story and characters are incredible because they were always incredible. these things didn't get better because they didn't need to. the good things about the original last of us are still good. the issue is that the things that weren't good still aren't. so why does this game exist? the enhanced graphics are nice, but it's not as though the last of us was ever bad-looking. the original also received a remaster a year after it launched, which still holds up. the graphics didn't need to improve, but they did. the gameplay did need to improve and didn't. when i reached the end of my playthrough of tlou part 1 and watched the credits roll, all i could think of was why i would play this if not for review — and i couldn't come up with a good reason. the 2013 release of the last of us was highly influential. the brilliantly-written-and-performed story is as good as ever in the last of us part 1, and the introduction of dozens of new accessibility features should be celebrated and emulated. the visual quality is staggering, bringing the emotional highs and lows of the last of us to the fore more than ever. unfortunately, the gameplay that was passable in 2013 isn't good by today's standards. calling a game that hasn't improved on a fundamental level a ""remake"" is a stretch. tlou part 1 is for super fans of the series or those who missed the first two versions, especially for accessibility reasons. for everyone else, it's hard to recommend spending the 15 or so hours it takes to play through the last of us yet again.

70,https://stevivor.com/reviews/the-last-of-us-part-1-review-an-expensive-re-remaster/,Stevivor,65,"the last of us is an undeniable masterpiece, a well-crafted title that rightfully made a couple stevivor staffers’ “best games of the last ten years” lists (including my own) not too long ago. but therein lies the problem: the original last of us on ps3 is less than ten years old and has already been followed up with a ps4 remaster called, unsurprisingly, the last of us remastered. with that name already taken, sony’s now released the last of us part 1 on ps5, but don’t let that fool you: this is the same ps3 title you’ve played many a time before, re-remastered and with a premium price tag. if sony and naughty dog can retread the same content, so can i. back in 2013, our own matt gosper described the title as “the story of joel and ellie, a survivor and a child in a world ravaged by an outbreak that has destroyed civilisation as we know it. taking the role of joel, you’ll journey halfway across the united states in search of answers and a better life, all while doing your best to protect ellie in the face of an unrelenting world.” matt continued on to say that, “in the game’s setting, the cordyceps fungus – a parasite that targets and takes over insects to spread its spores – has mutated and adapted to humans, resulting in a variety of horrifying mutations which leave the host as nothing more than a mindless killer. it’s an interesting twist on the standard ‘zombie apocalypse’ trope, made all the more terrifying if you’ve ever taken the time to read about cordyceps as it behaves in reality.” playing for the most part as joel, you’ll settle into a third-person, behind-the-shoulder view in a post-apocalyptic usa, usually with an ai-controlled companion in tow. in some segments, you’ll explore the environment, slowly piecing together (as the player for the most part, though ellie is a bit sheltered as a 14-year-old) how this world came to be. you’ll be forced to fight other survivors or, worse yet, the zombie-like beings that have toppled the world. joel is armed with an arsenal of weaponry, from guns to 2x4s or bricks, and can craft items like health packs and shivs, the latter of which aren’t only useful for stealth killing zombies, but accessing locked doors that contain always-useful supplies. naughty dog has painstakingly moved to bring the last of us to modern times in terms of visuals. ellie’s model looks straight out of the last of us part 2 — and likely is, thanks to flashback sequences found within that game — while part 2‘s lighting effects have also been employed. at face value, the last of us part 1 looks as good, if not better, than any current ps5 title out there. cutscenes are where this re-remaster shines, with extremely lifelike models, animations and facial expressions. the care and attention put into part 1‘s facelift is commendable, though sadly — and just like a real facelift — is ultimately superficial. the real problem with this package is that gameplay hasn’t been given that same treatment. despite promises that ai behaviour has been improved upon, you’ll immediately notice when your npc companion just walks out in the open right in front of human or zombie enemies… just like back in 2013; thankfully, it doesn’t matter to gameplay now as it didn’t then either. i audiably groaned when my flashlight fizzled out for the first time and an on-screen prompt suggested i wiggle my dualshock — oh, sorry, make that my dualsense — to turn it back on. while they were standard at the time, unnecessary ladder puzzles or segments where you squeeze through narrow passages — aka bits that were hiding the playstation loading the next area for you to explore — stand out now that we have super-fast ssds and no need for such artifical barriers. lemme borrow from myself now, circa 2014: “i know the game’s story. i’m aware of what happens in its tragic prologue, and that carries all the way onto its epilogue. “just with your favourite movies, they’re still amazing and enjoyable, but you can’t recapture that experience you have when you walk into an unknown property. if you’ve already played the game, it mightn’t be worth jumping back in so quickly.” sony’s even taken to the playstation blog with the giraffe shot (above). the giraffe shot! you remember that — it was neat! it’s decidedly not a spoiler anymore, because we all know it. back in 2014, i wasn’t thrilled that sony repackaged the last of us using a strategy as it’s again adopted for 2022. though, with the option for double the framerate than before and gameplay that was only a year old, there was still something to be said for remastered at that time. that’s also more allowable given that the ps3 wasn’t as widespread as the ps4 or even the ps5, in terms of user adoption in their respective generations. the problem here is that anyone with a ps4 has — or at the very least, should have — played the last of us already. now on ps5, it’s a much harder sell: this is a ps3 game that looks like a ps5 one that’s also been jacked up to sony’s premium, $125 aud current-gen console title price point. that’s unacceptable. if you’re one of the very few playstation owners that hasn’t played the last of us and doesn’t require the fantastic accessibility options found within part 2 and now part 1 — or you’re not a hardcore trophy hunter — you don’t need this game. the last of us remastered on ps4 is priced at $25 aud on the playstation store (and likely cheaper at physical retailers) and will certainly get the job done. that’s $100 aud less than what this title is on offer for via the same marketplace, and it really boils down to that. good looks can only get you so far. this is like an old pc game that gets an hd texture pack by a modder, except that has already happened, officially, from sony on ps4 and is again happening now. and you’re paying a premium for it each and every time. the last of us part 1 was reviewed using a retail disc and current digital patch on ps5, as purchased by stevivor. click here to learn more about stevivor’s scoring scale and click here to read more about our post-launch sony reviews. steve's the owner of this very site and an active games journalist for close to fifteen years. he's a canadian-australian gay gaming geek, ice hockey player and fan. husband to matt and cat dad to wally and quinn. we’ve been featured on google news since 2014, and apple news, opencritic and metacritic since 2016. we were added to the game awards’ jury in 2017 and the game critics awards e3 panel in 2018.

as naughty dog's crown jewel, the story of joel and ellie is a timeless one that has received more plaudits than the majority of games throughout history, taking home over 200 game of the year awards. now back on playstation 5 for its third release in less than a decade, everyone wants to know whether the remake is actually worth it. it's a fair question. naughty dog is one of the most talented developers in the world, so the fact the studio felt it necessary to remake a game that has surpassed 20 million sales globally instead of focusing on another inevitable sequel or a new ip altogether is one well worth raising. it's also clear that the remake is a marketing tactic to help promote the upcoming the last of us tv series on hbo max. so who is this remake really for? going forward, the ps5 remake is without a doubt the definitive way to experience the story. anyone that hasn't played the game before needs to remedy that immediately, and there's no better starting point than here. equally, those that have played only played the 2013 release and not the remaster will feel some benefits. for everyone else, including those truly devoted fans, it's hard to justify another purchase. set 20 years after a fungal plague has decimated half of the human race, a survivor named joel is tasked with escorting 14-year-old ellie across the now post-apocalyptic us in hopes of creating a cure and ending the nightmare. along the way, the pair encounter hunters, smugglers and various forms of infected humans, known as clickers. alongside this, the last of us part 1 comes with the last of us: left behind dlc (it was included in the 2014 remaster too). the prequel tells the story of ellie's relationship with her best friend, riley, set before and during the events of the main game. i would deem it essential to the overall narrative, so don't skip out. naughty dog's aim for the remake was to bring the game closer in line to its ""original vision"" if the studio was not constrained by technology at the time. that seems harsh considering how striking the 2013 release was and still remains to be. so much has held up admirably well, be that the traumatic opening as i personally now rocket ever closer towards fatherhood (help), a deadly virus as we all 'exit' a global pandemic, or the simple things like ellie learning to whistle over the course of the journey. new ways to play through the last of us have been added, including a permadeath and speedrun mode. the former basically means if a player dies at any point during the game they have to restart the whole thing over again, although it can be tailored to per season or per chapter for those less daring. the latter is to test how fast the game can be beaten, perfect for the speedrunning community and twitch. these both feel quite niche extras, with only a small percentage likely to use them. on top of this, there are now more unlockable outfits, a model viewer mode to check out designs in greater detail, as well as the previously released the last of us podcast from the cast and crew and director's commentary. great. what's not great is locking this all behind the player having to beat the game considering the number of returning players. seems like an oversight. furthermore, multiplayer (factions) is absent altogether. it's a strange thing having the mechanics of a 2013 game coated in something that has graphics from 2022. it works, obviously. this is the last of us. it's just certain little things like naughty dog's obsession with moving crates, or how joel crouches down to awkwardly craft which have become a bit comical at this point. the last of us gameplay has players controlling either joel or ellie from a third-person perspective, as they progress through cities and wilderness across the us. players can shoot using pistols, shotguns, rifles and more, however, bullets are sparse meaning stealth or fleeing is sometimes the better option. molotovs and nail bombs are also examples of weapons that can be crafted. if not, hand-to-hand combat is an option. haptic feedback improvements now mean that combat is further enhanced, felt in every punch thrown. likewise, the adaptive triggers have been taken advantage of – most noticeably when using the bow and arrow. i did feel weapons across the board utilised the technology better in sniper elite 5, though, providing a better push and pull that i rarely found with standard weapons in the last of us. ai has received an upgrade. enemies are now more aware of joel's presence while stealth has been enhanced to avoid buddies running into the path of others. i still found ellie getting caught in front of enemies just as much as in the original, so there's still some way to go to make it seamless. very few technical issues were apparent, aside from a couple of minor bugs where ladders or skips would go through surfaces momentarily. motion matching is another tech that makes characters follow logic to try and match the desired movement from hundreds of different animations to replicate real-life scenarios. it sounds impressive, i just never really spotted the difference. is that bad? i appreciate the feature but things like this often seep into the background. naughty dog has also integrated its extensive accessibility system, including audio description built-in to the cinematics – a first for a playstation game, according to the studio. huge applause for this. having more people be able to play a game comfortably is only a positive. now onto what is arguably the biggest question of the lot: is the graphical upgrade worth it? the answer is yes and no. my mixed feelings stem from the fact that, on one hand, the new overhaul in models, textures, environments, lighting, and pretty much everything you can think of is clearly a step up. it's gorgeous! a truly stunning game, only amplified by the new next-gen capabilities. on the other hand, i do think some of the original's gritty charm has been lost. the streets were more grubby, the characters felt more dishevelled, it's a consequence of updating old games to today's standards. the lighting plays a big part in this, working well in more grassy areas but putting an unnecessary shine on buildings. additionally, i prefer the look of the giraffe in the original. i don't know why. i get it's more lifelike but i miss its adorable wide eyes. there i said it. new workbench animations fall much more in line with the sequel, watching joel carefully upgrade a pistol's magazine bit by bit is awe-inspiring... even if it does feel slightly tedious. what does feel more of an upgrade are the breathtaking vistas, giving a wider scope of the surrounding areas in the likes of boston, pittsburgh, salt lake city and wyoming. the same can be said for destructible objects, shattering more glass or firing off chunks of wood when penetrated by bullets. from the technical specifications, the last of us part 1 offers 4k resolution at 30 frames per second or dynamic 4k resolution at 60 frames per second. these are outlined in performance and fidelity modes within the settings. i always opted for performance, yet still felt i was reaping the rewards of its graphical overhaul. hdr support is also available. finally, while the subtle soundtrack by gustavo santaolalla is untouched (rightly so), 3d audio has been integrated, all with the aim of creating better immersion. this works best when in the dankest conditions when being stalked by clickers, helping to identify where the infected are attacking from. on a couple of occasions, it did make me jump as a result. as this is my fifth time playing through the last of us, i can roll credits in a good 10 hours or so. anyone attempting the game for the very first time will likely be closer to 16 hours. naturally, this is all dependent on how you explore the world. are you the kind of person that reads every scrap of paper, likes to grab every firefly pendant as well as all other collectables to pop the platinum trophy? if so, i'd say the playtime will be around 25 hours for newcomers. the last of us: left behind takes approximately two hours, again extending to around three if you want to find all of the collectables. it's absolutely worth experiencing, just as integral to the main story while fleshing out ellie's backstory. the last of us part 1 is still one of the best games of the last decade and an absolute must-play for newcomers. for anyone making the unforgettable journey with joel and ellie for the very first time, this is a five-star experience. despite that, due to a lack of incentives – aside from the graphical glow-up – as well as a steep price of entry, it's hard to justify a second (or even third) purchase for returning players. the logical suggestion for anyone that enjoys the last of us will be to play its 2020 sequel, the last of us part 2. while not spoiling anything, it does feature a controversial story that split the fanbase but likewise brought about some interesting discussions. if you're looking for something lighthearted, then do check out the uncharted series from naughty dog, which features fun indiana jones-like globetrotting adventures. with the uncharted: legacy of thieves collection launching on ps5 earlier this year, it's the perfect time to jump in. matthew is the staff writer for t3, covering news and keeping up with everything games, entertainment, and all manner of tech. you can find his work across numerous sites across the web, including techradar, ign, tom's guide, fandom, nme, and more. in his spare time, matthew is an avid cinema-goer, keen runner and average golfer (at best). you can follow him @mattforde64 ",9975

regardless of your thoughts on the matter, however, people have generally accepted that enhanced ports are okay as long as they provide substantial enough enhancements. skyward sword hd, for example, got revamped controls with a bumped-up framerate and resolution. marvel’s spider-man remastered got an increased framerate, ray tracing support, and all its dlc collected in one package. there’s a line that companies have to carefully tread when deciding if it’s worth releasing a remake. the last of us part 1 crosses that line. the last of us part 1 is a completely rebuilt version of the post-apocalyptic 2013 classic designed from the ground up as a playstation 5 console exclusive. bucking the trend of sony’s recent director’s cuts, this is a fully-fledged remake in the vein of 2018’s shadow of the colossus. unlike the bluepoint-developed shadow of the colossus, however, this remake was created entirely in-house by naughty dog. the original development studio getting a chance to redo one of its most beloved titles, taking what was learned from the development of three big-budget third-person shooters released since — including a sequel to that title — is an exciting prospect. unfortunately, naughty dog’s ambitions with this remake of the last of us were placed entirely in the wrong areas. while there are some appreciated under-the-hood changes, the main selling point of the last of us part 1 is a very expensive coat of paint for a game that already looked and ran fine in its first remaster. i understand why sony wanted a shiny new version of the last of us on store shelves. not only is it a fantastic way to get people even more excited about the still hard-to-find playstation 5, but it’s also a way to bring fans of the upcoming hbo series into the playstation ecosystem. from a business standpoint, it makes sense to have a state-of-the-art jumping-on point for new last of us fans built from the ground up for ps5, rendering each and every one of joel’s individual beard hairs with such breathtaking fidelity that it’s easy to forget you aren’t watching a prestige television series. while the last of us remastered on playstation 4 is still a fantastic-looking game, it’s understandable that sony would want new fans to have the best possible experience with the first game. the last of us part 1 brings the first game more in line with its sequel. this rerelease makes back-to-back playthroughs of both games in the series flow much more naturally. the overarching story of the last of us feels like a more cohesive whole now because of part 1’s increased fidelity, as if you’re playing through two halves of the same story that just so happens to be on multiple discs like a ps1 jrpg. if there’s one thing to praise about the last of us part 1, it’s that new level of fidelity. while nothing about the plot has been changed and no new lines of dialogue have been recorded, the exceptionally enhanced presentation brings the drama to new heights. the game’s prologue is a known tear-jerker at this point, but the new facial expressions and animations make it feel like you’re witnessing the tragedy for the first time all over again. a thousand emotions are reflected in ellie’s eyes when she utters her famous “okay” in the game’s finale. the game’s most heart-wrenching scenes will hit just as hard as you remember them. this is genuinely one of the best-looking games ever made, which is to be expected from a studio of this caliber. that brings us to the last of us part 1’s biggest problem: the price tag. this is a fully-fledged $70 release. in a world where the last of us remastered not only retails for $20 brand new but can also be downloaded for free via the playstation plus collection on ps5, something which the overwhelming majority of ps5 owners will have access to, it’s hard to justify paying a next-generation price for a game that most people have already bought twice. when the last of us remastered already exists, runs at an upscaled 4k/60 fps, and is backward compatible with the playstation 5, is there any reason to buy the last of us part 1? had the last of us never received an enhanced ps4 port, this remake would be welcomed with open arms by most, but as it stands, it feels like sony is trying to sell the last of us remastered remastered just to pad out the ps5’s exclusive library. not only that, but the last of us part 1 is actually a less feature-complete game than the last of us remastered. there are a handful of minor new additions to this remake such as a speedrun mode, permadeath mode, model viewer, and dualsense controller support, but those aren’t enough to make up for the glaring omission of the fan-favorite factions multiplayer mode. while a standalone factions game is on the way, its absence in the last of us part 1 still hurts. however, one major new addition will make the last of us part 1 more than worth the price of admission for a select few players: a remarkably in-depth accessibility options menu. naughty dog set a high bar with the accessibility features of the last of us part 2, and this remake takes things to the next level with options never before seen in a video game. one such innovation is the ability to play dialogue through the dualsense controller as haptic feedback, allowing hard-of-hearing players to feel the emphasis and intonation of spoken lines. the accessibility features of the last of us part 1 aren’t going to be a huge selling point for the general public, but thanks to naughty dog’s efforts, this game will be playable for the very first time for some people. that’s important. there are multiple presets available by default and the controls and settings can be fine-tuned however you see fit. despite the other issues surrounding the last of us part 1, this aspect of the game deserves to be celebrated. outside of pricing complaints, the last of us part 1 also feels much more dated in the gameplay department than you would think. game developers have come a long way over the last decade and naughty dog is no exception. this is a game that predates not only the last of us part 2 but also uncharted 4 and the lost legacy. naughty dog’s game design philosophy was incredibly different back then and it shows. the jaw-dropping visuals work against the gameplay in this aspect as well, making the aging skeleton of a linear ps3 game much more noticeable regardless of how many polygons the shotgun has. naughty dog’s level design chops have improved dramatically since the initial release of the last of us, and while there are still plenty of memorable set-piece moments like the terrifying hotel basement in pittsburgh, the moment-to-moment gameplay experience is much duller than i remember. the last of us part 1 functions as a window into the past where naughty dog still had a lot to learn. it was an exceptionally talented development studio at the time, but it has become an entirely different level of world-class since then. that’s not to say the combat encounters and exploration segments of the last of us part 1 are bad — quite the opposite actually — but with its visual presentation surpassing anything naughty dog has done to date, it’s hard to not feel let down by the comparatively bog-standard gameplay. at the end of the day, it’s still the last of us though, and even though its gameplay limitations have only gotten more apparent with age, this is still a fine adventure. that’s why this review is so difficult to write and why most will likely have complicated feelings about the last of us part 1. the core game is beloved for a reason and this remake does enhance the experience a great deal, but it’s hard not to wonder what could have been if as much attention was given to the level design and combat encounters as the visuals. the last of us part 1 is a remarkable technical achievement that nobody asked for. yes, the ai has been improved. yes, the workbenches have the cool upgrade animations from the sequel. yes, there’s 3d audio. but when you can already play a good enough version of the last of us for free with the playstation plus collection on ps5, why bother? with a hefty price tag and less content than its more than acceptable ps4 counterpart, the last of us part 1 is an entirely unnecessary remake with gorgeous graphics that only make its dated gameplay stick out even more.

74,https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/08/the-last-of-us-pt-1-remake-review-higher-fidelity-blood-sweat-and-tears/,Ars Technica,"NA"," in some ways, this new series looked like the stunning uncharted games we'd already seen on the playstation 3. it was full of realistic characters, detailed environments, and convincing movie-like dialogue. but this wasn't a shooting gallery interrupted by wild train sequences and epic climbs up mountains. instead, tlou appeared to host the tensest and most brutal combat ever seen on a gaming console. a camera dramatically swung around two survivors of an apocalypse, and these resource-starved protagonists tiptoed around dangerous foes (humans and zombies alike), always one low-on-ammo gun jam or wrong step away from certain doom. one year later, the game launched to accolades and high sales figures, but it didn't quite resemble that dramatically staged ""real gameplay"" trailer. the final game's enemy ai, battle choreography, and presentation of player choices felt more video gamey than we saw in the trailer. i remembered that old sense of disappointment while i played the last of us pt. 1, this week's ps5 remake of the 2013 original. honestly, there were moments while i tested this note-for-note remake where i felt adrift, enough so that i saw cracks in its handsome, ""current-gen"" facade. this is not a perfect remake, and it may leave both new players and naughty dog diehards disappointed in some respects. but when i finally got far enough in the dark, compelling campaign to relive its jump-scare corridors and epic battles and saw the progress that had been made since 2013, i got it. tlou pt. 1 is a rare example of a gaming publisher pointing to a classic ""bullshot"" trailer, then telling a team of developers, ""you get to finish the job. you get to make this look and feel like that amazing trailer."" and in enough respects, naughty dog has done just that. as far as remakes go, tlou pt 1 splits the difference between ""wholesale rework"" and ""massive touch-up."" in terms of narrative and world design, most of the original game has been preserved. environments, conversations, puzzles, hidden collectibles, and even codes to locked safes are the same. naughty dog spent years cutting its teeth on three uncharted games on the ps3, and the original tlou was the console's grotesque-yet-beautiful swan song, a game that was able to squeeze incredible environments and dramatic stories out of sony's famously cantankerous console. the game eventually received a native ps4 version, which merely bumped the resolution and frame rates, yet even this simple port turned out to be one of the ps4 generation's prettier games for a few years. so we're not looking at something like demon's souls or even link's awakening as remade on the switch—where the graphical foundation is so massively shifted that you can't help but gawk at it. tlou pt 1's graphical leaps are impressive, but they may pass you by if you're not constantly flipping back and forth between the original material. to make my own point, i tested the new version for hours before going back to compare, at which point i realized i was remembering the ps3 original through rose-tinted glasses. the new version's upgrades are so organic that they appear without much fanfare, as if this is how the game originally looked.

75,https://www.destructoid.com/last-of-us-part-1-ps5-impressions-review,Destructoid,"NA"," i’m not sure i needed two more versions of the last of us, but here we are. back in 2014 when the ps4 remaster came out i had little interest in playing it again, as it was just too soon. but eight years is a long time, and a lot of folks probably are interested in another go-around. last of us part 1 is now the best way to facilitate that. due out on september 2 on ps5 and at a later date on pc, the last of us part 1 is a juiced-up remake, taking the ps4 version even further with redone visuals and tons of toggles/options. it’s essentially the same game with some bells and whistles — and the same story beats and characterizations. playing through it, i found that the visual makeover was a nice bonus (mostly from a performance point of view), but it didn’t fundamentally alter my experience with the last of us. the first 15 minutes or so remain one of the most captivating portions of the game, and the new visuals definitely help get the point across, coupled with top-notch performances. you can see the enhancements for yourself in the video below. as a note, this edition also comes with the left behind dlc, which is just as well since this “part 1” repack is $70. you can select it immediately from the start (which is nice for folks who already played the original sans dlc and may want to dive in here for the first time). left behind is also treated as a separate game of sorts with unique save files. from a visual standpoint, there are a lot of comprehensive sliders, allowing you to toggle a host of options like hdr and separate technical modes, which target 40 fps at 4k (fidelity), or dynamic resolution at 60 fps (performance). i’m going to be real here: some of the character model changes don’t really bother me. i never really connected with some of this cast in the first place, so several of these changes don’t move the needle for me either way. but the accessibility menu (menus, really) is the crown jewel here, and if you’ve ever played last of us but disliked one particular aspect of it, you can basically customize it out of existence with the ps5 version. i feel like the past few years have been the “era of the toggle,” and it’s been great. there’s fully customizable controls, as well as visual aid, motion sickness, and sound considerations. that latter part is pretty important to showcase, as the dualsense can play dialogue via haptic feedback [rumbling]. as far as extras go, there’s concept art, a character model viewer, video galleries, and skin/filter/speedrun/commentary options. there’s more widespread accessibility options like screen readers and navigation assistance, all the way down to awareness indicators and auto pick-up options. preset control schemes are available, but you can swap everything around at will. the hud can be customized, motion sickness can be curbed, and you can even enhance the listening mode range and add infinite underwater breathing. even enemy accuracy, aggression, damage, resource/ammo quanitity, and stealth can be manipulated individually. if you were ever frustrated with any aspect of the gameplay in the past, you can likely change it. if you’ve already experienced this story and said “i’m good,” you probably don’t need to pick up last of us part 1. the fanatics who played it 10 or more times already probably had this pre-ordered already. that leaves the most important group: total newcomers. while the last of us still has some of the same issues the original debuted with in 2013, the ps5 version (and likely the upcoming pc port, based on sony’s past efforts) is the best way to play it to date.

77,https://www.shacknews.com/article/132092/the-last-of-us-part-one-ps5-impressions,Shacknews,"NA"," reworked lighting and shadows, upgraded textures, and solid quality-of-life features make this the definitive way to experience the original last of us. naughty dog has nearly always been at the cutting edge of delivering the fullest on what a playstation game can do and the last of us franchise has been a recurring prime example of that. the games have been toted time and time again as some of the best action, storytelling, and visuals that playstation studios titles have to offer. there was a bit of confusion, then, when naughty dog announced it would be rebuilding the first last of us for the ps5. still considered to be quite the stellar game, there was wonder at what would be improved. my answer after playing it is… almost everything. the last of us part 1 takes the full power of the ps5 and brings the most expressive edition of joel and ellie’s original story yet. i went back and forth between playing the last of us part 1 and the last of us remastered (which was upgraded for the ps4 pro around 2017) to get a good look at the changes. while not every detail will stand out as noticeably upgraded, there are some incredibly well-reworked visual effects that stand out no matter how you look at it. static and unnatural lighting are no more in the last of us part 1. the entire game has been rebuilt with new lighting and shadow effects that give a massively improved air of natural beauty and grime throughout the game. one particularly standout detail was at the very beginning of the game when tommy, joel, and joel’s daughter sarah are trying to escape when they drive by a house on fire. in the original, the fire effect seemed strapped to a house which looked static even as it was burning. in part 1, that same house is pluming smoke and flames from every orifice and wood and materials are collapsing in real-time as it breaks down. further along when tess meets a contact in boston to open a secret path, we see light poke through the windows where previously it was an unnaturally lit room with little reaction to the daytime outside. further still is a church in bill’s town in which sunlight is transformed through the stained glass at the back of the altar. every single bit of this game is lit and shadowed in a way that serves to deepen the immersion. a lot of the textures in the last of us part 1 have been upgraded too. joel, ellie, tess, bill, and other characters look far less doll-like and emote far better. joel has serious fatigue under his eyes that actually seems to move as he responds to various situations. meanwhile, i could actually see light flowing through the follicles of tess’s hair as i walked behind her in different areas. even npc characters that weren’t as detailed felt more real, emoting properly in response to given situations in expressive or even subtle ways. the guard that lets tess and joel get into robert’s hideout in the beginning isn’t as detailed as other characters, but he does have this coy smirk about him when tess hands him a stack of illegal ration cards and asks where robert is. these details all serve to keep a solid mood throughout the game. the animations have really taken a bump up too. there was definitely some jank in the last of us remastered that naughty dog was able to iron out in tlou2. the sheer range of movement and situation-specific animation was a highlight of the game in our review and naughty dog has brought that pedigree here. characters respond to the environment, combat, climbing, falling, and more in ways that rarely ever left me rolling my eyes due to some obviously silly glitch or ai failure. that said, for all of the polish on the last of us part 1, it wasn’t without any smudges. i felt this way regularly about interaction with water. in the rain, characters’ clothes get wet, but when swimming in water it seemed as though joel’s hair and skin might stay wet for a moment, but his clothes would dry instantly. it seemed strange given that horizon forbidden west did a great job with water and its effects both out in the rain and while swimming. another notable exception occurred in one alley in bill’s town. i got cornered by the infected and tried to melee my way out. joel eventually died, but instead of a biting death animation from being killed by the infected, he kind of just slumped backwards over his own knees with his arm going all wet noodle. it was a very fallout death for a last of us game, albeit one of few exceptions to an otherwise impeccable presentation. the additions to the last of us part 1’s visual textures and effects are definitely the star of this remake, but there are a lot of little details, changes, and additions that take the game to the next level as well. for one, the last of us part 1 features an entire new list of accessibility options brought over and even upgraded a bit further from the suite of similar options found in the last of us part 2. you can now adjust subtitle size, assign colors to characters speaking, alter combat options, activate colorblind modes, activate sound and visual cues to aid in exploration, adjust difficulty from crushingly hard to story mode easy, and so much more. this is also one of the first naughty dog games to feature description commentary for blind viewers. flipping this option on has a voice describe the setting and actions going on in the scene even as the characters carry out their activities. this feature was a standout among the additions that naughty dog implemented with the aim of improving upon tlou2’s award-winning accessibility and players or viewers with most impairments will likely be happy with everything available here. beyond accessibility, there are further improvements throughout tlou part 1’s gameplay that all players will likely appreciate. for instance, much of the ui has been reworked to be far less clashing with the on-screen action. it’s minimal when it needs to be, but even when the ui is there, it’s far more out of the way while still being informative. the alert system has also been improved. it still plays the airy effect when you’re in danger of being spotted, but now there’s also a confirmation when an enemy is fully aware of your presence and ready to go on the attack. other little improvements include things like being able to bring up a clear text reading of any notes and documents you find instead of trying to have to make sense of the graphical scrawl. there's even a well-implemented speedrun mode to keep track of how fast you play each encounter, chapter, and a whole playthrough if that's your jam. that said, i wasn’t wild about every change naughty dog made to the game. the new listening mode feels worse than the original. everything is much fuzzier and sometimes it was hard to make out where enemies were looking or what direction they were facing based on the fuzzy white blobs that would appear even when listening mode was upgraded. likewise, previously when you aimed the bow in tlou remastered, you would draw an arrow. now you have to hold the fire button to draw, which felt a little less easy to handle for me, even if the dualsense puts a little more oomph into the bow’s handling. a lot of qol changes in the last of us part 1 feel good. instances like the ones mentioned unfortunately feel like one step forward and two steps back. if you’ve never played the original last of us, i would argue this is the version worth playing. the upgrades over the original are quite numerous. from the upgraded visuals and impeccable work done on lighting and shadows, to the expansion of accessibility options and even new ones over the last of us part 2, and finally a multitude of subtle gameplay improvements that make the whole experience all the more enjoyable, this is a fully upgraded package. i won’t say every “improvement” is actually an improvement or even necessary, but the sheer amount of polish added to this version of the game likely ensures i will never go back to the last of us remastered over part 1, given the choice. these impressions are based on a playstation 5 digital copy supplied by the publisher. the last of us part 1 comes out on ps5 on september 2, 2022, with a pc release to be announced at a later date.

Club,"NA","what happens to heartbreak when it’s relentlessly polished? repackaged, reiterated, resold, again, and again, and again? does it maintain its potency? or does something profound transform itself into something that’s merely a product? 2022's the last of us: part i is an excellent video game, for the simple reason that 2013's the last of us was an excellent video game—and part i is a beat-for-beat remake of naughty dog’s masterpiece, devotedly recreating every single inch of its harrowing cross-country road trip through a zombie-ravaged united states. every moment in the relationship between hardened survivor joel (troy baker) and teen hero ellie (ashley johnson)—still one of the most convincing pairings in all of gaming—remains intact. (literally; it’s the same performances, recorded nearly a decade ago at this point, but imported into new animation rigs.) every combat encounter, whether with murderous humans or fungus-ravaged wretches, persists. it’s all here, every violent, painful moment. the only meaningful differences—for all that naughty dog appears to have moved heaven and earth to recreate the entire game on new tech for this “new” version—are that part i carries a host of welcome accessibility features, it looks somewhat nicer, it now runs natively on the playstation 5…and it will now cost players another $70 to acquire. make no mistake: the accessibility features in the last of us: part i (mostly adapted, like many of the technical elements of this remake, from 2020's the last of us: part ii) are robust and thoughtful. sony remains at the head of the pack at finding multiple angles to make their games playable for the widest array of people, and part i’s additions include aids for the game’s visuals, its sound, and its gameplay, all designed—like the new audio descriptions for cutscenes, or high-contrast modes that make items easier to pick out in the game’s crowded environments—to make this a game that as many people can enjoy as possible. accessibility is the one metric on which part i is unambiguously superior to its previous versions, and if it’s a make-or-break issue for you, it’s a very easy game to recommend. sounds good feature excellent noise cancelling, high-fidelity audio thanks to triport acoustic architecture, multiple sound modes, and up to 24 hours of battery life. elsewhere, well… it’s probably going to depend on how long it’s been since you last played through the last of us, honestly. this is the best version of this game that’s been made to date (of the several that sony has trotted out onto shelves over the last 9 years), a totally faithful recreation of cordyceps-ravaged boston, lincoln, pittsburg, and beyond, now mildly enhanced in a number of small regards. nothing has been broken here in the pursuit of next-gen ideals; where part i has gameplay faults, they’re sins that have persisted throughout tlou’s lifetime—like a mild over-reliance on the same three stock “puzzle-solving” elements (oh, to never move another awkward physics-object dumpster like it’s suddenly 2013 all over again), or a combat system that wants you to reflect on man’s cruel indifference to man, but which often conjures thoughts of the last of us’ cruel indifference to its players’ patience, instead. don’t get us wrong: tlou combat (sneak, shiv, shoot, repeat) is often fun, when you’re doing exactly what the game wants you to do. but the degree it goes toward punishing “bad” play to underline the fragility of your heroes has always been a momentum-killer. on multiple occasions, the game can tip over from “exhilarating” to “frustrating,” the relief at the end of a long combat encounter serving not as a parallel to joel and ellie’s exhaustion, but as a reflection of what a pain in the ass that particular battle became, somewhere around the third time a fresh wave of dudes spawned in to stunlock you with a hail of gunfire. (look: if you don’t want anyone to go poking your sacred cow, don’t bring it back to market with a fresh coat of paint slapped on, okay?) still, if this combat is your jam, it’s here, and abundant—especially since naughty dog has added in a new speedrun mode and a flexible permadeath mode that strips out some, or all, of the game’s checkpointing, for those who legitimately love that stuff. the aspects that are good, great, or sublime, meanwhile, are all right here where you left them . there’s the compulsive crafting system, which sees you happily scavenge every loose bolt from boston to salt lake city to meticulously enhance your guns. (the tactile way each upgrade is applied is one of those “attention to detail” things that’s always helped elevated this game above the pack.) there’s the steady sense of pacing that builds tension masterfully, then releases it in moments of genuine beauty or abject horror . and there’s especially that script, which, both in the base game and the included left behind dlc, ably channels the outline of a standard zombie movie into something a lot more personal and painful for both of our long-suffering heroes. for the first several hours of playing part i, though, the overwhelming sensation is simply one of deja vu, mixed with an ounce of awe at some of the new visuals. (most notable early on in boston, which feels much more like a barely-living city than in the original game.) you’ll round a corner, see a distinctive room layout, and a feeling of dread will sweep over you. “oh fuck, this is where the truck shows up.” “god, i remember these clickers being a pain in the ass.” “welp , time to meet henry and sam.” it’s to the credit of the source material that those nostalgic sensations eventually fade. by the time the game’s fantastic winter chapter rolls around, we were no longer looking for familiar map features, trying to do mental compare-and-contrasts. we were just playing the last of us, a rare tragedy in a medium that so rarely indulges in the form. the much-vaunted new animation system looks good, the ai imported from the last of us: part ii makes the enemies even worse bastards than they were before, and the game milks its new and updated apocalyptic skylines for all they’re worth. it’s a very good version of a game you’ve almost certainly played before; it’ll be a hell of a lure for the hypothetical non-players who end up watching the tv show when it debuts on hbo next year—and who then may want to go see what joel and ellie’s original journey was all about. the hollowness set back in, though, as we closed in on the game’s iconic, brutal, emotionally complicated ending. the last of us is a tragedy in the true sense—a story where people make the same awful choices again and again, even when they know the consequences will damn them. there is no version of joel miller who does not do what he does at this game’s climax, his heart locked in stone by mountains of trauma and love and need. playing through it again, shinier but exactly the same, we couldn’t help but feel similarly trapped in the past. the last of us: part i is a great game because the last of us was a great game—but the last of us already exists. it broke our hearts just fine on ps3 technology (or with the ps4 remaster); very little about the last of us: part i, for all its minor technical tweaks, makes the case that this remake was ever really necessary, except as a line item on sony’s budget. if that sort of philosophical distinction doesn’t bother you, more power to you; this is the nicest-looking version of the game there is, a more comfortable and accessible experience all around, and a nice showcase for the ps5's graphical power. the problems with its existence are largely extrinsic, a symptom of a model of aaa gaming utterly beholden to the safest, most tried-and-true choice—rather than embracing the same boldness that produced the original game way back when. the last of us: part i is an excellent copy of an excellent game. it’s a beautiful product, to be sure.

for story beats in the last of us part ii. if you’re visiting the series for the first time, tread lightly. it’s been nine years since the release of naughty dog’s seminal horror odyssey the last of us. it’s a game that was “remastered” for the playstation 4, roughly a year later. and today, we’re on the doorstep of a…remake? sony calls it a game “rebuilt for the playstation 5.” regardless, the world’s introduction to ellie, joel, and the now-iconic mushroom infected has been given a very shiny coat of paint for sony’s newest console. and we’ve played it. broadly speaking, waypoint wasn’t a fan of the sequel, the last of us part ii. but we still reviewed it, and spent many hours breaking down what didn’t (and some of what did!) work in a podcast. even if the last of us part ii was seen as a disappointing follow-up, it compelled conversation. no surprise, then, that revisiting the original prompts the same. people throw around a lot of hyperbolic words when it comes to the last of us. “masterpiece.” “goat.” “classic.” what i can confidently say is that the last of us left a real imprint on both rob and i, and so this “rebuilt” version of a game we both enjoyed was an opportunity to revisit the kinds of apocalypse stories video games usually tell, what kind of father joel is, and much more. we’ll have more to say on an upcoming podcast, but in the meantime, here’s what rob and i had to say when we had an opportunity to sit down and exchange thoughts on this update, having played a big chunk of the game. rob: you’d know better than i, but even by the standards of zombie horror, it’s always seemed to me like the last of us is uniquely about suburban dread and precarity. replaying it today i still feel like it is a gloomy mood piece that has a lot more to do with a dread of the city, anger at the loss of a particular vision of idyllic american life, and despair over the social atomization that attends the death of community. maybe this is why i always liked the last of us so much, and why the last of us 2 was so frustrating. the last of us works whether it fully knows what it is about, or whether or not it fully sees joel for what he is. he is a compelling antihero and most of the last of us functions as a kind of action-packed character study. the adventures joel and ellie have aren’t really important in themselves, they are a backdrop for this relationship and the way we see these two characters relate to the world, and the relationships they see others have developed with one another and this fallen world. i really wasn’t sure if i would still enjoy the last of us after souring so hard on the grim self-importance of part 2. i knew that i loved this game when it came out and felt it was probably naughty dog’s best or second best game, but i had my doubts about revisiting it because i feared that the things i disliked about part 2 had been there from the start, and that it was merely the novelty of the first game the prevented me from burning out on it. and yet here i am, patrick, pretty much enjoying the game as much or more than i did the first time. i don’t know that anything about it leaps off the screen to me in terms of wow-factor. i played the ps3 version and remember that as one of the best looking games i ever played, i think maybe the biggest success with this new ps5 version is that it’s not really jarring or flashy in terms of what’s been added. it just feels like a much more detailed world, one that better rewards lingering over its various tableaus and sets. for instance, i don’t recall the town that your friend and foil bill lives in as having much in the way of an interesting character, but there’s definitely a lot of establishing details of what kind of town it was, who lived there, and what bill has been up to in its ruins in the years since. it’s not important detail necessarily, but it is more legible here and certainly rewards a slower and more searching approach to play, which i think accentuates the slower, more elegiac quality that a lot of the last of us was going for originally. but hey i’m burying the lead here. because if i recall correctly, when this early pinnacle of dad-core games came out and really set the mold for this “morally compromised father figure guiding a surrogate child” subgenre, you were not yet a father yourself. so i am very curious how this is landing now that you are, well, much closer in your life to where we find joel and his daughter at the very start of this game. patrick: moments ago, i got a text message saying my daughter had been marked “absent” from school. i dropped her off at daycare, but the world takes over after that. the daycare gets her on the bus. the bus driver drops her off at school. she, then, has to walk herself to class. when i called the school, a woman asked “is this about jessica?,” the kind of question that briefly stops your breath. the school said it was probably a mistake—bus drivers chronically understaffed right now—but for a minute, i was on hold. it was only a few seconds, but in those seconds, your brain gets a chance to run wild at how things could’ve gone wrong the moment you stopped holding her hand. thankfully, it was all a mistake. anyway, i’ve never entirely forgotten how the last of us opens, but i didn’t fully appreciate what was about to unfold until i had the controller in my hand a few nights ago. i’d finished putting my oldest daughter, who turned six in the past week, to bed. i don’t know how old joel’s daughter is—my guess is roughly twice the age of my own, early teenager?—but even at six, my kid is a whole ass person. still figuring life out, of course, but a person. my person, in fact. and so the main difference between 2013 and 2022, a gap in which i went from not a father to a father of two, is that the game’s intro went from merely shocking to truly upsetting. like you, i have fond memories of that first game, primarily because of joel and ellie’s bond. (and, uh, because the combat is interesting and enjoyable, unlike anything in the uncharted games. i’m a sucker for spectacle, aka naughty dog’s specialty, but shooting in uncharted is frequently a slog, and i liked the last of us enough to spend time in the dang multiplayer.) the opening hours, especially, remain special. my favourite part of an alien invasion movie is the invasion, and my favourite part of an apocalypse movie is the onset of the apocalypse, when the dam breaks and civilization starts to collapse. that part remains so good here, and for as iconic as the series’ mushroom-y creatures have become, it’s remarkable how restrained the worldbuilding is early on. you spend hours in the last of us before you have any real sense of what happened, or what ongoing threats linger. it makes the first encounters with the infected all the more impactful, because you have zero clue what you’re up against, and it’s only informed by how scared characters like joel and tess are. those two won’t flinch against a man with a gun, but a clicker? they shit their pants. it’s great. perhaps the highest compliment you can make any remake is that it fits with—and doesn’t contradict—existing memories. i haven’t spent much time looking at comparison shots and videos, and so i genuinely don’t know how much different this looks compared to what came out nearly a decade ago. i’m sure it’s a huge leap, because that’s what naughty dog does! but what i can say is that it looks terrific, in the way it looked terrific when i first played it. is that worth $70, a wild amount to charge for a game that’s been re-released twice now? and while this world is dark and oppressive and full of death, it’s a story about hope—hope for joel’s broken heart, ellie’s sense of purpose, and heck, the world potentially getting a vaccine. gosh, i’ve missed that, and it was sorely lacking in the nihilistic sequel that came later. my favourite parts of the second game, a game i ultimately did not like but probably liked much more than you, happened in that early town. i wanted a whole game about that community. have you watched the television show station eleven? it’s a show about a very contagious flu-like virus that takes out most of the population. it’s an apocalypse story, but one that doesn’t assume the world on the other side is one with only violence and depravity. it follows a group called the travelling symphony, who move around performing plays, and trying to keep art and history alive. awful things happen in station eleven, but it’s the exception, not the rule. instead of presuming what rises from the ashes of disaster are the worst elements of humanity, it wonders what we might build in its place. it’s really beautiful. the last of us starts from a place where things are bleak. but there’s a chance to imagine another world, and the characters you’re with might play a part. i liked that then. i like it now. rob: i didn’t watch station eleven but it is one of my favorite books of the past several years. it’s a book that definitely made me think about the last of us a lot as i was reading it, and in retrospect i think highlights some of the issues with the sequel. station eleven has interesting thoughts about how a society fractures and what begins to rebuild it, whereas i think for the reasons you allude to, the last of us series is preoccupied with collapse. maybe that’s why it has to leave that town so quickly in the second game: the survivors’ community exists as a kind of edenic ideal, a place where joel cannot live for long because of his sins, and where ellie will eventually be barred from because of the weight of her own sins and trauma. but in the last of us part 1 isn’t consumed by the “cycles of violence” angle. it is instead about the tensions between wanting to be safe, emotionally and physically, and wanting to forge connections whose first requirement is vulnerability. i do think, as i replay this, i think naughty dog did an even better job with how they sketched out joel. i don’t think there is much hope for him, not really, and i think the game is aware of that and is sounding warnings about it throughout its runtime. we hope that he will bond with this little girl, we hope that they will forge a healthy, happy surrogate family. but from the very beginning of the game through his journey with ellie, i am struck by how consistently joel’s growing warmth and protectiveness is accompanied by the same hard selfishness that he shows in the opening minutes of the game. the crisis that defines the end of the game is taking shape throughout the journey, and we can kind of feel how so many joel’s best traits are tied to his absolute worst vices and impulses. i think one question i have for people playing through it again is, on this replay, do you think the death of his daughter actually changes him at all? or does it merely justify what was already there at the start? by the way, maybe this is mostly relevant to me but every time i play a naughty dog game i am reminded of how head-and-shoulders above most other games and movies that their audio mixes are. i think there are so many big-budget action adventure type things where you kind of have to choose between having dialogue be legible, having an immersive sensation of being in the action, and being safe from sudden volume spikes that will shatter windows and get your neighbors beating down your door. i guess something similar is happening with the way this game deploys hdr lighting: with only a few tweaks based on how i liked the calibration images to appear on my display, i’ve basically never had a moment in this game where i felt it was too dark for the game to be fun or too bright to be appropriately oppressive and obscured. i don’t know what the secret is. i always assumed there’s just a huge tension in how games and movies are being presented where settings for high-end systems are inappropriate for a ton of folks’ tv-and-headphones setups, and settings for simple stereos and older displays waste a lot of the capability that nicer equipment can provide. but naughty dog’s games always feel like they somehow deliver a system-maximizing spectacle no matter what you are using and it makes most other av sources, not just games, look half-assed by comparison. even if i hadn’t been away from this game for close to a decade, i think i’d be loving this remake just as an amazing showpiece for a good tv and sound system. with that said… do yourself a favor and turn that film grain waaaaay down. the game defaults to max film grain setting and in my opinion it is a really graceless digital effect that just intruding on every scene. i think there was a time you could plausibly argue that the grain called to mind cheaper films or more documentary-style shooting where filmmakers can’t or don’t want to light the scenes so well that the cameras can resolve really clean images. thing is, even cheap digital cameras handle bad lighting better than this, and the last of us certainly does not lend itself to some kind of b-movie grindhouse aesthetic. the absurdity of that pretense is even clearer here, where every scene is filled with the beautiful, picturesque ruins that give this series its defining style. of course, i haven’t been away from this world for that long. as you alluded to, we did all play the last of us part 2 fairly recently and do you find that is changing your reaction to how part 1 plays? i think there are times i miss some of the gear and gadgets i’d come to take for granted in part 2 but i think there is a desperate scrappiness to the first half of this game especially that i think i missed in the second game. there is an early shootout in the massachusetts state capitol where you get a single-shot hunting rifle for the first time and honestly the ensuing firefight in these long, backlit corridors between an invading army of military police felt fraught in a way that i’m not sure part 2 often did. ellie and abby are such practiced killers and commandos in that game, and abby especially gets so much military-grade hardware that in some ways i think that ends up feeling like a more traditional action game than part 1 does for much of its campaign. patrick: every game like this has a breaking point, a moment where it hands over enough ammunition and gadgets that combat becomes more about trying out new techniques than survival. for the last of us, it happens when the game provides a shotgun during the still-unforgettable chapter with bill, and immediately makes the clickers, fast and vicious infected who function as a one-hit kill against joel, less of a threat. prior to the shotgun appearing, items like the shiv are more valuable than gold. yes, you could use a shiv to take down a clicker in one go, but you’re not going to find enough resources to make another one, and that means you won’t have a chance to open that locked door around the corner. it’s cool to blow the face off a clicker with a shotgun. but less thrilling than being chased. i realize it’s possible to dial up this experience by playing the game on harder difficulties, but i’m not here for masochism—i’m here for sustained tension. and laughing loudly at ellie. tension, heavy breathing, and studying white blobs in the dark are defining visuals sketched into my memory, but what stands out so clearly upon revisiting is how damn funny ellie is. ashley johnson is a revelation. you anticipate a girl being the bait in a grand escort mission to be a pushover, but even while ellie is finding her survival footing, her whits are razor sharp. this is crytalized when meeting bill, and her response to his shit talking and attempt to handcuff her is to immediately grab a metal object and attempt to break his arm. get ‘em! and then later?? when she asks joel why the dirty magazine has sticky pages, prompting joel to lose his composure, and she deadpans “i’m fucking with you.”?? incredible. howling. i do think you’re onto something about joel, though perhaps i land somewhere differently. the way i found out about my father’s heart attack was a phone call. one moment, my life was one way. minutes later, my life had changed. at times, in my darkest moments, i think about another one of those phone calls, perhaps while my family is running errands, or my wife is coming back from a friend’s place with the kids late at night. when i think about what kind of person i’d become if that phone call ever came, it’s where i have the most empathy with the person we find at the start of us in the last of us: surviving but broken. i think it’s possible joel always was who he was, but his daughter changed him, softened him. i can say with conviction that’s been true of my children, as well. i’m a better person—more patient, empathetic—because of their presence in my life. you know how on a sports team, they’ll say “this person raises the ceiling of this team’s potential”? i think the best people in our lives lift us up in the same way, whether it’s children, partners, friends. they help raise the ceiling of your potential, but the floor remains the same. and if you remove them? it’s telling that naughty dog’s impulse in the sequel was to kill joel in the most brutal way, but without the courage to remove him from the story. it’s a concession the series is about joel and ellie, or betrays a confidence to move the narrative past them. both games start from the same place: death of a loved one. joel’s daughter dies in the most heartbreaking fashion possible, in the midst of chaos and confusion. joel is beaten to death, and it’s portrayed like a snuff film. naughty dog wants you to feel anger and rage. but i’ll tell you that i felt more of a reaction to the death of [redacted] in the last of us than joel. (i’m not sure what constitutes a spoiler at this point. i’m so confused.) more to the point, the death that sticks out years later is not joel, but his daughter taking her last, desperate breaths. i don’t tend to replay games, but i’ve already played far more of the last of us than i needed to for the purposes of this exchange with you, rob. there’s no reason that i needed to see the end of the section with bill and play 30 minutes into the pittsburg section, except that i felt a compulsion to keep going. i will probably beat this game in the next few weeks, too. revisiting the last of us makes swallowing the bitter pill that is its sequel even harder, because instead of making me better appreciate the story being told about these two characters over the span of years, it makes me long for a different ending for them both.

81,https://twinfinite.net/2022/08/the-last-of-us-part-i-review,Twinfinite,100,"almost ten years after its original release, we now have a “from the ground up” ps5 remake. but is it worth your hard-earned cash? few games have left such an indelible mark on the gaming industry as naughty dog’s cinematic survival horror opus, the last of us. first released back in 2013 as a playstation 3 exclusive and then 2014 as a playstation 4 remaster, it managed to earn numerous accolades and game of the year awards, and deservedly so. now, almost ten years after its original release, we have a “from the ground up” remake built specifically for the playstation 5. i’m going to cut right to the chase: if you’ve not played the last of us yet, it’s safe to say it’s one of the best games ever made. from its deeply thought-provoking and tragic story to its nail-bitingly intense horror-action to its stellar post-apocalyptic world-building, sony’s beloved horror ip tells a resonant story that will stay with you long after the credits have rolled. you assume the role of joel, a likable father whose heart is heavy with loss. following a global pandemic that transforms its victims into violent zombie-like monsters with a penchant for human flesh, modern society is turned upside down as governments around the world scramble to control the threat and curb the infection’s spread – by any means possible. as time lurches on, pockets of primitive civilization begin to rise from the ashes, but it’s a resistance group known as the fireflies that may hold the key to finding a vaccine that will potentially bring an end to humankind’s suffering. while on paper this sounds like a slightly trite setup – and in reality, it kind of is – the way the story is presented, performed, and grounded so deeply in reality is what makes the moment-to-moment experience of the last of us so utterly compelling. you see, the infectious fungal disease at the heart of the game’s story is in fact a real-life affliction. thankfully, however, in the natural world, the cordyceps fungi strictly prey on insects and haven’t yet made the jump to humans. (phew!) in the last of us, though, naughty dog asks the rather timely question: what if the cordyceps virus did make the jump to humans? *shudders* mechanically, the last of us plays out like a third-person survival horror experience with an emphasis on stealthy cat-and-mouse gameplay, crunchy melee combat, and intense shootouts. outside of combat, you’ll be spending a lot of your time scrounging every nook and cranny for resources to help you craft a consistent supply of useful items like molotov cocktails, nail bombs, and health kits in a bid to aid your ongoing survival. meanwhile, slotted between all of the nail-biting gameplay sequences are some of the best-acted and best-written video game cutscenes ever conceived. even to this day, the last of us stands tall as one of the biggest achievements in the entire industry from both a narrative and visual perspective. no small feat, indeed. however, now that we’ve established how gosh darn incredible the last of us is, many of you may be wondering what this brand-new ps5 remake ultimately brings to the table. and with that in mind, there is quite a lot to discuss. while the core of joel and ellie’s narrative remains intact in the last of us part i, a huge amount of effort has gone into the game’s new facial animations, environments, enemy ai, and freshly implemented dualsense and 3d audio features. let’s start with the newly improved facial animations, then, and you’ll be surprised by just how much extra nuance and richness has been eked out of the already outstanding performances from troy baker (joel), ashley johnson (ellie), jeffrey pierce (tommy), annie wersching (tess) et al. not only has the overall fidelity of the game’s facial capture been dialed up a notch, but you’ll notice small touches to how the characters react and emote during cutscenes that were a little harder to discern on last-gen hardware. further, the environments have largely been overhauled as well, with improved lighting and textures. some areas even boast supplemental details that weren’t in the original – like the boston statehouse museum’s bottom floor – which was mostly empty in the original but now houses historical artifacts like art canvases and busts of prominent american political figures. on top of this, this new remake introduces the immersive upgrade system from 2020’s sequel the last of us part ii. essentially, instead of simply seeing joel’s back as he upgrades his weapons at a workbench like on ps3 and ps4, this new version sees the specific weapons getting their very own makeover replete with new components like a new muzzle or a new grip, for example. in short, the newly implemented upgrade system combined with the additional boost to fidelity really helps to add an extra layer of realism to an already phenomenally realistic-looking game. but this new ps5 remake isn’t just solely focused on the cosmetic side of things as there have been numerous tweaks made under the hood. namely, the enemy ai has been much improved, too. enemies behave in a more dynamic way when compared to the original: stalkers hide in the shadows more, clickers and bloaters move more aggressively, and hunters flank you more tactically than before. outside of this, though, are some terrific accessibility options. there are a plethora of different ways you can tweak the gameplay to your liking. from alternative controls to screen reader and audio cues to combat accessibility, there are a lot of options to dig into to help tailor the gameplay experience of the last of us part i to your personal preference, which is always laudable. finally, the newly implemented dualsense and 3d audio features are worth a shoutout as well. as is par for the course with ps5 exclusives, the dualsense helps add extra texture to the immersiveness of the world: using a health kit requires additional tension to pull the r2 trigger down, for instance, while you’ll also be able to “feel” the drizzle of rain or the bluster of a blizzard through the controller as well. additionally, the 3d audio sounds excellent and really helps to amp up the tense horror atmosphere, especially with a pair of sony’s pulse 3d wireless headsets. i’d be remiss if i didn’t mention the elephant in the room, though. while this latest version of sony’s classic shines brightly on cutting-edge hardware, it’s worth mentioning a poignant and provocative question that rears its ugly head: in short, is the last of us part i remake really necessary? this would mark the second time the game has received the remaster/remake treatment in less than a decade, which does feel – especially for someone who bought each game – a little much. in truth, the answer to that will vary greatly from person to person. what i will say is this: naughty dog’s masterpiece is absolutely essential; if you’re yet to experience it, the last of us part i is a no-brainer. if, on the other hand, you’re one of the many folks who’ve already experienced the original, this revamped version is undoubtedly a slightly tougher sell. without the factions online multiplayer component, and with a cost of living crisis going on right now, the reality is it’s hard to not feel like you’re getting a package that is a touch lighter on content than its original iteration. nevertheless, deep down in my heart of hearts i feel like there’s never a bad time to revisit a classic. much like the extraordinary writing within the game, the last of us part i often centers on the small things. visual improvements, ai upgrades, and dualsense features help elevate one of sony’s most critically acclaimed and influential exclusives of all time. taken as a whole, it’s a very human tale that feels just as vital as ever. and with this faithful remake, here’s hoping that a new generation of gamers will get to experience one of the best games ever created. period.

82,https://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2022/08/31/the-last-of-us-part-1-review-ps5-worth-buying-playing-2022/,PlayStation LifeStyle,90," for almost a decade now, i’ve been calling the last of us a masterpiece. it’s remained my favorite game of all time and i completely agree with the playstation lifestyle reviews that awarded the original ps3 version a 10/10 and the ps4 remastered version a 10/10. unfortunately, the third time doesn’t quite boast the same charm — the quality remains and notable improvements have been made, though a steep price point makes this a much more difficult sell than its predecessors. with the last of us tv show set to release on hbo in 2023, there’s no doubt going to be a large influx of players diving into the franchise for the first time. having better parity between the games will be fantastic for newcomers and it’s important to remember that naughty dog isn’t just making part 1 for established fans. as much as i love tlou and have done for a long time now, i can see the bigger picture and the reasons for this remake to exist a mere eight years after the remastered launched. when the tv show audience moves across to the game, they will find a (presumably) similar tragedy of a man struggling to deal with loss and fighting hard to change that losing streak, no matter the cost. the game’s protagonists, joel and ellie, are played by video game acting superstars troy baker and ashley johnson, who provide both voice and motion capture. their fantastic performances in the original game are elevated here with enhanced visuals and animations — the characters’ eyes are especially impactful when paired with emotional dialogue. joel and ellie must journey across a post-apocalyptic united states, dealing with infected enemies and human hunters. death is but a bite or gunshot wound away making for a brutal reality that is channeled through the characters’ desperate need to mercilessly murder and loot in order to survive. the infected us hasn’t just been “upscaled” to look decent on ps5 — it has been rebuilt in large parts, with naughty dog making significant changes to level geometry, textures, and lighting. i found areas with water particularly impressive when moving between remastered and part 1. a veteran of the post-apocalyptic world, joel doesn’t mess around when facing a threat. like in the original release, he’s capable of stealthily taking out enemies one by one and manipulating their movement by throwing bottles or bricks as distractions. once spotted, joel wastes no time in punching the hell out of the opposition, infected or human, before grabbing them and curb-stomping them dead. like in part 2, the photorealistic visuals can lead to some jarring moments where the ultraviolent scenes can look a little too real. the gameplay in part 1 is mostly the same as the original, so joel can’t make use of the crawling or dodging mechanics seen in part 2. however, there is additional polish to animations that makes transitioning from stealth to an aggressive assault look and feel exceptional. part 1 has the fluidity of part 2, especially when gaming at higher frame rates, which is a valuable achievement. the improvements to friendly and enemy ai were immediately noticeable. during stealth sequences, allies in the original and remastered used to awkwardly maneuver in front of enemies. while this didn’t alert them, it did break immersion. in part 1, this only happened to me once, and it was during a moment where i was testing its limits, forcing multiple enemies to surround ellie to see how she’d react. when playing properly, it’s no longer an issue. enemies are also smarter now, similar to how they are in part 2. they are more tactical in their flanking routes and are less predictable when peeking from cover. for anyone that has played through the original on grounded difficulty — maybe even twice, for that damn trophy! — you’ll be familiar with optimal routes through levels. many of these strategies will need rethinking thanks to part 1’s bigger-brained foes. if i’m to nitpick, there’s one remaining area of jank that has been overlooked: the animations when dropping down from a ledge. characters have to drop down a surprising number of ledges, and they just sort of clumsily slide or float when doing so. considering the incredible attention to detail seen in literally every other animation, i’m surprised that this process isn’t more elegant. fans of the ps5 dualsense’s haptic trigger feedback will be happy to hear that part 1 fully embraces it. different weapons have a different “feel” based on how easy they are to fire. it’s a fun little gimmick that does its job, though i’d personally disable it as the added physical friction can be frustrating. as also seen in part 2, naughty dog has gone above and beyond what most other developers do by implementing accessibility features to help those who are visually impaired and/or hard of hearing. and if, like me, you’ve already beaten the last of us on the more punishing difficulty settings, rest assured that there are new challenges to tackle in part 1. permadeath and speedrun modes have been added for those who want to test their skills. like with the remastered version, part 1 bundles in the left behind dlc, which explores the story of ellie before she meets joel. unlike the remastered version, the faction multiplayer component is totally missing from part 1. as an enormous fan of this mode in the original, i was very sad to learn this. hopefully, naughty dog is making quick progress on the standalone the last of us multiplayer game to help fill this void and justify the omission. part 1 also includes the great director’s commentary, alternative skins, concept art, and other goodies. most of this could already be experienced in the remastered version, though, so it would have been nice to see naughty dog push the boat out with this definitive version of the game with some fun additional weapons, or potential tie-ins to uncharted or other playstation franchises. something extra to make part 1 stand out and justify the purchase price would have helped reduce the sting a little. but while there are a number of great additions and improvements here, the last of us part 1’s greatest enemy isn’t its zombies — it’s the steep price point. the last of us part 1 is launching at $69.99 (and $79.99 for the digital deluxe edition). that is $50 more expensive than what the last of us remastered is currently available for. that is a steep ask and, though it’s clear that a hell of a lot of work has gone into part 1, it’s a price that even i as a hardcore fan find off-putting. the last of us part 1’s $70 price tag comes at a bad time for sony, as the company is already causing controversy by increasing the price of the ps5 in non-us countries. combine that with the cost of living crisis impacting many areas and you’re looking at a target market that isn’t quite so eager to spend. i’d feel a lot happier with part 1 and 2 being bundled together for $70-80, or part 1 being sold separately for $40-50. if you can fling yourself over the price hurdle, the last of us part 1 is absolutely the best version of the single-player game. the environments look superb, the characters are rendered perfectly, and the gameplay remains super satisfying. what’s more, the game has been opened up to a wider audience with a comprehensive suite of accessibility settings, and veteran players can sweat it out in the permadeath and speedrun modes. the price tag is cheeky, undoubtedly, but if anyone can pull off this wallet heist, it’s naughty dog with the last of us.

83,https://checkpointgaming.net/reviews/2022/09/the-last-of-us-part-i-everything-clicking-into-place/,Checkpoint Gaming,90," naughty dog’s the last of us left an impactful impression when it first released back in 2013. the adventure pushed the gaming medium forward with mature and evocative storytelling backed up by some of the highest quality production values that could be found at the time. it’s a game that lingered with me all these years later thanks to its haunting personal story and questionable ethical messaging explored brilliantly by an a-grade voice cast. even the game’s sequel didn’t quite resonate as profoundly, despite being a masterpiece in its own right. returning to witness the original game again, remade for the ps5, was simply an opportunity too tantalising to pass up. despite already being remastered for the ps4, the last of us part i’s updates are instantly noticeable. the opening cinematics and in-game footage showcase incredible attention to detail as the world around our protagonist joel succumbs to a zombie apocalypse. facial animations, lighting, reflections, textures, and more are realised in impeccable detail as naughty dog once again pushes the playstation hardware to its full potential. the game looks as good if not better than 2020’s part ii, with a lifelike environment and true-to-life character models making it feel like a living and breathing recreation of our world. any non-realistic visual characteristics found here are deliberate choices made to improve the aesthetics, with the game refusing to fall into the uncanny valley and instead adopting minor creative liberties such as slightly exaggerated eyes that well with emotion. the lighting overhaul is perhaps the most impactful of the game’s visual updates. having both graphical and gameplay implications, the more severe lighting is great at creating genuine terror and misery. entering a new environment with just the vision cone of your flashlight is a masterclass in horror game design. adding the flickering torch mechanic first introduced in its 2020 sequel where you have to physically thump your dualsense against the palm of your hand is also such a nice touch. the clever implementation of dualsense features brings you closer to the horrifying world, but more on that later. “the absolute terror of the different zombie types can almost entirely be attributed to their gurgling, screeching, and clicking audio presence.” the last of us always had sublime audio design and that’s taken one step further here. the absolute terror of the different zombie types can almost entirely be attributed to their gurgling, screeching, and clicking audio presence. the way the game toys with the player by having a clicker emit a loud and abrupt shriek as you sneak up behind it is just so dastardly. i frequently thought i was alerting enemies to my presence when i wasn’t, and it meant i was forced into a constant state of unease. combine those affecting sounds with the game’s realistic graphics and dark shadows and you have a recipe for incredible horror. the gameplay has been tweaked somewhat to align part i closer to its 2020 sequel. played as a behind-the-shoulder combat adventure game, the last of us part i takes gameplay inspiration from the stealth genre as well as third-person action games. ammunition is limited and so you’ll utilise the environment to your advantage as you duck behind waist-high walls and obstacles, moving behind your foes for a silent and deadly takedown. get spotted and it’s time to go guns blazing with both human and zombie enemies susceptible to a quick and nasty bullet to the brain. melee weapons with limited durability, as well as throwables like molotov cocktails or bricks, are also at your disposal. it’s a varied combat system where you’ll often be adapting your approach due to resource limitations and the situation at hand. combat feels good and getting up close to perform a stealth or melee kill always feels aggressive and visceral. be warned, the improved visual fidelity of the game makes these scenes even more uncomfortable than the original release. certain to make those who play feel squeamish, horrified, or emotionally distraught at many moments throughout, the last of us part i was not and still isn’t for the faint of heart. though know that if you were able to make it through part ii, you’re unlikely to see anything here that’s more distressing. narratively, the game still holds strong as one of the best examples of storytelling within the medium. joel and especially ellie are such likable characters. their bond and interaction is core to the entire game’s messaging from the opening scene to the game’s closing moment—even if the character(s) themselves aren’t found within those scenes. it’s such a deep and personal story that wins out over the ‘save the world’ cliche that the game could have easily adopted. the banter, arguments, affection and more shared between these two carries the gruelling journey and keeps things grounded and relatable. outside of cutscenes, the narrative doesn’t let up, with conversations continuing to flesh out the characters and environmental storytelling continuing to flesh out the world. in this sense, the storytelling can be quite adaptive, with choices made and paths chosen during gameplay having an impact on the way the characters interact. certain dialogue may never trigger if you don’t take some time to explore and find that note. it’s a real treat that allows the last of us part i to combine gameplay and narrative seamlessly and invite the player deeper into its engrossing world through immersive storytelling techniques. once credits roll that story can even continue with a prequel in the form of left behind. it’s a much shorter experience but one that’s equally captivating as it continues to highlight ellie as a character. left behind also introduces queer themes for the first time as we see ellie breaking the mould of a traditional gaming protagonist in some really iconic and fantastically representative ways. whilst the game is largely one big journey, the setpieces and events that occur along the way keep things fresh and engaging. whilst playing i was constantly on the lookout for the next “thing” that i knew would happen in the game/story. and despite having played before, those moments still left their mark—whether it made me crack a goofy smile or had me biting my lip in empathy. every time i put the controller down for a break, it was after a vital story beat or pivotal gameplay section. to have your game littered with these moments is a staggering accomplishment of game design excellence. seeing the improvements from the original 2013 release to this remake highlights a level of passion and care put into this project. whilst you may not love that a recently(ish) released remastered game was already getting a full-priced remake, you can’t deny the effort and attention to detail that went into this release. it’s not just the visuals, audio, and gameplay tweaks. the artificial intelligence is also much better, with your companions far less likely to do something goofy like run straight past an enemy whilst you’re stealthing around. the dualsense controller features like haptics and adaptive triggers just immerse you deeper into this already rich world. there’s even a new speedrun mode with an in-game timer for those who like to challenge themselves to get things done quickly. possibly the most impressive update has to be the game’s accessibility features which again are just top of their class. the options menu is extensive with toggles and sliders allowing you to customise almost every single element from audio to subtitles to visuals and gameplay. features like screen readers/audio cues/visual aids and more just go above and beyond and highlight the care that has gone into making sure the last of us part i is able to be enjoyed by as many different people as possible. if there was any room for improvement in the last of us part i, it would be further gameplay, combat, and design changes to align the game closer with its 2020 sequel. that’s not to say the last of us doesn’t feel good to play, but it doesn’t quite have that same level of gameplay freedom and ingenuity as the second. stealth occurs pretty much only behind waist-high walls, so say goodbye to fields of grass. the areas you play in are less open, removing some level of exploration and removing that little bit of freedom in approaching combat sequences from different angles. you also won’t get those same gameplay moments with the rope, which just proved to be a more advanced and enticing puzzle mechanic than stuff like dragging pallets through water for ellie or moving planks to cover ledges. it’s minor, admittedly, but going from part ii to part i will still have some noticeable downgrades in gameplay and design. as an overall package though, the last of us part i is still incredible. is it enough to get a returning player to pay to try it out again? maybe. should it be enough for those who’ve never played the game before? absolutely. for my taste, this is one of the best video games ever made and it’s looking and feeling better than ever with this remake on the playstation 5. the last of us part i finds a way to make an already incredible game even better. it may not be the most needed remake in the landscape of gaming, and i can’t fault anyone for not wanting to pay full price for the experience, but it’s undeniable just how much work has gone into this release. phenomenal graphics, superb sound design, immersive duelsense controller features, beneficial gameplay tweaks, and the best suite of accessibility features found in gaming. the last of us part i is a must-play title for anyone still yet to experience joel and ellie’s story. the dark pictures anthology: the devil in me hands-on

last of us has been remade for ps5, but what has actually changed? there’s only one question anyone wants answered with the last of us part 1 and that’s… why? the original is rightly regarded as a modern classic and while being nine years old makes it sound relatively ancient, it was released right at the end of the playstation 3 era and in terms of visuals was well ahead of its time. a year later it was remastered for the playstation 4, a version which many complained was overly expensive and offered no substantial improvements. and now history is repeating itself on the playstation 5. back in 2014, remasters were all the rage but now remakes are more fashionable, primarily because the difference a remaster makes from one generation to the next has become largely trivial. a remake is essentially a brand new game and that combined with the passage of time has convinced sony to charge full price for this new version, almost doubling the cost of the game from its original release. the last of us part 1 is not only the most expensive version of the game ever but also the most content light, since it completely removes the multiplayer element – no doubt because there’s a standalone multiplayer game coming next year. at the same time, essentially nothing has changed about the core gameplay, so since we’ve reviewed the game twice already, we’ll be focusing primarily on the remake itself. for anyone that has not played the last of us before our review of the remaster still holds true (minus the multiplayer), but in short the game is mechanically very similar to the uncharted series, with a little less platforming and a lot more stealth. which is to say it’s a third person action adventure with a focus on cinematic presentation and relatively simple mechanics that are very welcoming to casual gamers. the majority of the story takes place 20 years after a zombie apocalypse, with you taking the role of embittered survivor joel, as he’s tasked with escorting a young girl named ellie to meet with a government resistance group called the fireflies. it’s implied that joel has done many questionable things to survive over the last two decades, but a father-daughter bond quickly begins to grow between the pair, as they avoid both zombies (caused by fungal infections) and fellow survivors. the third person action is solid, but the real appeal of the game is the two central characters and the performances by troy baker and ashley johnson. it’s not just the fact that the remake costs £70/$70 that seems so preposterous but the fact that naughty dog, who have only made three new, full-priced games in the last decade, should waste their time on such an unnecessary endeavour – one that could have been, and according to rumour initially was, given to someone else to handle. there are lots of good reasons to remake a video game. given how quickly they can age, the graphics alone can be a good enough excuse, but if a game’s as old as, say, resident evil 2 it inevitably also has outdated controls, interfaces, and other issues. which is why capcom’s remake was so warmly received, as it updated everything and yet still managed to keep the same tone and basic gameplay as the original. age alone isn’t the only consideration though. sony’s own shadow of the colossus and demon’s souls were both only a little over a decade old when they were remade but the originals had such significant performance issues that a remake made perfect sense. that was especially true as they didn’t involve taking time away from the original developers and, especially in the case of demon’s souls, greatly raised the profile of a game that on its original release was completely ignored by the mainstream. none of this applies to the last of us. the playstation 4 remaster has aged extremely gracefully and under more sensible circumstances would be used as a clear example of why remakes sometimes aren’t necessary. there are so many good reasons not to have a remake of the last of us it’s genuinely difficult to answer the question of why it exists. of course, there’s the glib acknowledgement that it exists solely to make money, but an almost equal amount could probably have been made from a much simpler remaster. the other reason is, presumably, that this is intended as a companion to the upcoming hbo show. although the idea that non-gamers, intrigued by the show, would’ve turned away in disgust at the playstation 4 era graphics (or bought a playstation 5 just to play it) is patently absurd. in naughty dog’s mind, perhaps they felt they wanted to lessen the difference between part 1 and part 2 but it was never so significant that there’s any kind of visual whiplash when playing the two in quick succession. and despite everyone assuming they’d make the remake’s combat identical to part 2 they haven’t, which isn’t a problem but it is another odd decision to add to the pile. all the talk of improved graphics and dualsense support ignores the fact that it was the narrative journey of its characters that turned everything upside down in the sequel, not any radical change in the graphics or gameplay. that’s why the two games are so renowned, and that aspect hasn’t changed one iota in the remake. the graphics are improved, there’s no question of that, but never to any significant degree. like most remakes and remasters all they do is keep pace with your memories and if you’re not studying a comparison video at the time, you’d swear they hadn’t changed at all. the backdrops and lighting are undoubtedly better, but the changes to the character models and faces are not the major leap forward that sony and naughty dog seem to think they are. they’re barely any closer to being photorealistic and that largely seems to be down to the limits of the nine-year-old motion capture data and the original art style. joel in particular almost looks like a caricature, with his square shoulders and painterly features. the weird crab walk he does when you spin the camera also looks peculiarly awkward and old-fashioned, for what’s supposed to be a state-of-the-art remake. it’s the world, rather than the characters, that benefits most from the upgrade, with clever details like cars where the suspension is still working as you clamber over them and the way the water moves when you wade through it. although the bisected zombies that now crawl along the floor at you are perhaps the most impactful addition. that and changes to how the artificial intelligence work are the closest the game gets to any fundamental gameplay changes, although, as with the graphical changes, the fact that all the enemies are now more dynamic and independent doesn’t feel notably different from the original. ally characters have less of a tendency to creep around in plain sight, when they’re supposed to be hiding, though, which was a common problem with the original. there are new features but they’re tiny things like a speedrun mode, concept art, and unlockable skins and gameplay modifiers. you also get the admirable range of new accessibility options from part 2. and yet, strangely, the main menu shows selections in an almost imperceptibly different shade of white – which makes getting to the menu, to change the menu, peculiarly difficult. given that the playstation 4 remaster is still easily available for a fraction of the price (it’s also free with ps plus premium) it’s very hard to justify the last of us part 1 as a sensible alternative. that doesn’t mean the underlining game isn’t still good, it’s just this ludicrously expensive way of playing it is one only for superfans and the idle rich. incredibly, the digital deluxe edition is even more expensive, at an eye-watering £80/$80, and yet it also includes absolutely nothing new, just early unlocks for things like explosive arrows and weapon skins. a fact we still can’t believe, as we double-checked the listing multiple times, convinced we must’ve missed something. the far more interesting question than why this remake exists is whether the last of us itself still deserves its classic status, since it’s not just graphics and gameplay that can lose their lustre over time but the underlying design. what might be surprising to those that haven’t played the game before, is that the plot is deceptively workmanlike. the set-up is that of a bog standard zombie post-apocalypse and a lot of the middle section of the game can be very generic, elevated only by naughty dog’s cinematic presentation and the excellent performances of the actors. where the game excels is at the beginning and the end, when the story is at its most unpredictable, with the finale raising all sorts of interesting questions about the empathy, grief, and the selfishness of familial love. whatever faults you might find with the game, its narrative highs are exceptional and it’s still only its sequel which can claim to equal the emotional impact and sheer craft of its storytelling. this doesn’t come without cost though, both literally and figuratively. while the finale revolves around a single, vital decision, you have no control over it at all. naughty dog stories are never interactive and, especially with the hbo show coming up, there’s an important discussion to be had as to whether the last of us actually gains anything from being a video game, rather than a movie or tv show. you could say that the level of immersion is greater by being a game, and that by virtue of this remake having better graphics that is increased, but that’s really the only argument in its favour. this is clearly the definitive version of the last of us, and yet the changes are so trivial it’s hard to recommend to anyone. in short: a completely pointless remake of one of the best games of the last decade, except with only half the content and at double the price. pros: one of the best linear narratives ever in a video game, with superb performances and incredible presentation. solid, if unremarkable, action. excellent graphics, even if at first glance they don’t seem to have changed much. cons: unreasonably expensive. no multiplayer mode and no new content. the graphical changes are more impressive on a technical level than an artistic one and make little difference.

inplease refresh your browser to be logged in one of naughty dog’s greatest titles is finally getting the remake treatment the original ps3 release of the last of us is arguably one of the greatest games ever made, and has managed to transcend the cultural barrier that few action-adventure games do in mainstream media, so much so that hbo is banking on one of its next big original shows on the property. so, when recreating a near-decade old game from the ground up – while simultaneously trying to stay true to what made it great, it’s easy to remember the source material through rose-tinted shades and question how much of an improvement this latest remaster has made, especially when a ps4 remaster already exists – and is available for free with every ps plus subscription (£15.99, playstation.com). so what sets the appeal of a remake, titled part i, apart and why does us video game developer naughty dog see fit to charge £69.99 for it? yes, there are some much noted improvements, as well as an entire raft of extras, but only for the most ardent flag-bearers to potentially sink their teeth into, much like the clickers that shamble through tlou’s ruinous yet breathtaking landscape. by using the cast’s original motion capture to act as an anchor for the game’s cinematic scope, part i is able to add new levels of detail, such as a single tear rolling down the cheek, to the glimmer of joel’s eyes through a thousand-yard stare. but make no mistake, this is an idealised version of the original – a technical feat in itself. the last of us is one of those controversial titles that people either love or hate for numerous reasons. character-driven storytelling supported by tight mechanics and thoughtful environmental design contrasts with its “jarring” ending and segue into part ii’s shocking introduction. but, in our eyes, it’s still a masterpiece of the medium. will part i change anyone’s mind about it if they feel differently? absolutely not. but what part i does represent is a premium package of a title that is regularly cited as an all-time great. despite that, there’s only a handful of cases in which part i could be recommended: if you have never played it before or you want to re-experience it off the back of the last of us part ii. our playthrough of the last of us part i is based on a digital ps5 version of the game, where we were able to play through the main story as well as its additional content, left behind. we also used the opportunity to make use of its heavily advertised ps5 features, such as dualsense support, 3d audio and faster loading times. there are also a number of accessibility features that have been added and, while we have made an effort to see how effective they are at making the game more inclusive, the reviewer does not identify as someone with a visual or hearing impairment. from the last of us’s devastating opening minutes, the graphical improvements in part i are immediately apparent in comparison with its older versions, with detailed lighting and shading helping to capture the essence of a world on the brink of collapse. despite its bleak story and setting, tlou has always been vibrant in its presentation, but after spending enough time comparing frames side-by-side from their original cutscenes, it’s more evident how the ps3 version’s colourful backdrop was compensated by a colourful “bloom” to make its foliage stand out. here, the overgrown backdrop is just as visually remarkable, yet it just sits on the cusp of photorealism, at least out of the foreground. in detail, its more-destructive elements are more apparent. glass shatters with force in gunfights but also crumbles with delicacy as joel vaults a window, leaving remnants scattered underfoot with a gentle crunch that can be audibly heard as well as felt in the dualsense controller. part i’s attention to detail is helped in some parts by the game’s original level design that gently funnelled players through tight spaces when compared to part ii’s open-ended segments, so it’s good to see naughty dog make use of that space to expand on its existing area, rather than simply enlarging it. with character animations, cutscenes help to establish the improvements to facial animations. supporting characters such as tess, sam, and henry have had major changes made to their appearance while still retaining the same performances of their actors, while ellie, as one of the protagonists, has more noticeably been redefined, aligning more with her appearance in the sequel. much like the last of us part ii, part i has included a number of accessibility features. most notably high contrast modes as well as customisable huds and even audio described cutscenes – supposedly a first for a videogame of this scale. one of the most interesting features to be added is the ability to play dialogue through the dualsense controller, which can be used to “feel” the delivery of each line, whether it’s a sharp whisper or a sudden angry outburst. it’s quite impressive as a practical use for the playstation 5’s hardware, which clearly shows a lot of thought has gone into making the experience as accessible as possible for everyone. as well as accessibility, the dualsense has also been put to good use with other in-game features. one particular example was being able to feel the tumblers of the game’s numerous safe locks with enough sensitivity that it could be opened successfully without looking at the screen. as you would expect from a playstation studios title, it’s an excellent showcase for its own tech that can tangibly improve the experience. the same can be said for 3d audio support. when playing with compatible headphones, having a surround sound experience is noticeably more beneficial and gives players a sense of the space around them. the last of us’s worst enemies, stalkers, have a tendency to scuttle around and pounce on players from behind. being able to accurately pick out their position in a pitch-black space made a lot of difference. in terms of how part i plays, the promise of improved mechanics may have left fans with the impression that it would take a page out of part ii’s book in terms of manoeuvrability, speed and brutality but the most notable changes are in its user interface and menu systems. items are laid out in a more intuitive way and quickly swapping between items is much less cumbersome as a result. while it may seem like a missed opportunity to have joel sprinting around, jumping prone while lighting molotovs, it does make more sense for his character (who is in his 40s at this point) to be less agile than a teenage ellie was in part ii. his stealthy approaches, attacks and movements all carry a deliberate weight to them, which feels more appropriate. part i also has a number of hidden extras that can be unlocked by collecting points for completing chapters, finding hidden collectibles and playing on higher difficulties. some of these extras include concept art from both the original game as well as this remake, cosmetic upgrades as well as gaming commentary and even podcast episodes. however, many of these extras are unavailable to players until they are able to finish the main story. it would have been nice to access some of these “behind the scenes” features earlier on as part of the experience, as quite likely this would be many people’s third time playing this game from beginning to end. the last of us is (and always was) a masterpiece and part iis unquestionably the best version of it yet, but that may not be enough for anyone hoping for a complete reinvention of the formula from the ground up. part i adds just enough to warrant its remake for the latest hardware, which elevates it to the same level of the last of us part ii in smart design choices, flexibility and technical prowess even if it’s still the third time we’ve made this journey before. if naughty dog’s original ps3 version was the critically acclaimed theatrical release, then part i is the criterion 4k remaster complete with commentary and behind-the-scenes footage. if you’re looking for discounts on technology

88,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gaming/features/last-us-part-1-review-post-apocalyptic-ps3-classic-gets-next/,Telegraph,80,"naughty dog have worked wonders to bring their ps3 classic into the ps5 era but the £70 price tag could well put off players does the videogame industry have a problem with the repackaging and preservation of its past? it's a poser i found myself returning to more than once while playing this cutely rechristened revision of naughty dog’s 2013 masterpiece, the last of us. (in my defence, this is my third playthrough of the game, having already endured and survived the post-apocalyptic odyssey in both its original ps3 incarnation and also its ps4-era remastered form. and that, evidently, is part of the problem.) other entertainment industries readily revisit classic content too, of course. but in contrast to most videogame ventures, remade films and tv shows tend to require a fraction of the time commitment from the consumer, and typically bring something creatively new to the table beyond shot-for-shot symmetry. the preservation angle is arguably more weighted in videogames’ favour given that, in this post-digital age, it’s rare that cultural artefacts from other media are rendered obsolete by the demands of the hardware required to access them. although that argument holds less sway here when you consider the last of us has already sold over 20 million copies, is yet to blow out the candles on its tenth birthday cake, and is still perfectly playable on any of the 100 million-or-so playstation 4s currently in global circulation. demon's souls this ain't. it’s even harder to defend sony’s pricing strategy. despite the game’s ps3 heritage, the last of us part 1 comes with a hefty ps5 price tag – and while it's easy to see where the money has been spent in every pristine pixel, £70 would still be an audacious ask even if its audience wasn’t caught in the middle of a crippling cost of living crisis. this frankly short-sighted cash grab will force fans of the series to think long and hard about whether they can afford yet another version of a game they likely already own at least once, no matter how much they'll enjoy it. even newcomers are unlikely to consider this the no-brainer purchase it should be. ultimately it's sad a cynical commercial decision will overshadow naughty dog’s artistic achievements because in many respects the last of us part 1 is an aesthetic and technological triumph. advance publicity materials promised the game had been rebuilt from the ground up to take advantage of the ps5’s processing power, and it’s difficult to overstate how much the new background textures, character models, and animations add to the immersive experience. the post-apocalyptic north american backdrop for joel and ellie’s first (the) road trip never wanted for atmosphere but the generational leap in environmental detail exponentially grounds their reality, the decades-dead cities now feeling truly lived-in. the lighting alone deserves to win every award going. similarly trailed gameplay improvements can be more difficult to discern, mind. the original’s ungainly user interface has been replaced with part ii’s more intuitive menus and the tweaked control systems make combat less clunky than before, but the much-improved enemy ai can’t disguise some of the game’s more dubious design decisions – many of which are now only evident in retrospect. indeed, returning to part 1 after its superlative sequel can be an unexpectedly chastening experience that illustrates just how much creative director neil druckmann and his team learned in the intervening years from working on both uncharted 4: a thief’s end, and also the wonderful left behind, the last of us’ narrative-heavy dlc episode, also included here. part 1’s highs remain truly vertiginous but the overall ride isn’t quite as smooth as you might remember, the expositional beats and action sequences not always finding a seamless rhythm. and for all their subtle skill in both building and maintaining tension throughout, the guiding hand of the developers is a little too noticeable at times, particularly during some of the middle third’s overly scripted shootouts and set pieces. and therein lies the rub. the last of us is irrefutably one of the best games of the ps3 era but it's beginning to feel of its time – and beneath its gorgeous next-gen glow-up, part 1 is still, essentially, the same game. which wouldn't be a problem at all were it not for that troublesome next-gen asking price. a thought struck me while creeping through the sniper-infested suburban pittsburgh cul-de-sac of part 1’s second act: if the last of us was an xbox exclusive rather than a playstation one then this update would likely be available on microsoft’s subscription service, gamepass, from launch. sony has so far steadfastly resisted pursuing a similar release strategy but amid the ongoing evolution of its own playstation plus offering, perhaps the japanese giant could afford to be a little more forward thinking with regard to its own past. we urge you to turn off your ad blocker for the telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.

89,https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/lifestyle/article/the-last-of-us-part-1-review,British GQ,"NA"," video games are weird. for all of hollywood's myriad flaws, there is never going to be a remake of the godfather, disney is not going to bastardise the empire strikes back as a 10-part streaming series and timothée chalamet won’t be deep faked into humphrey bogart’s spot in casablanca. and yet, this kind of timelessness is rare for even the most lauded of games. the graphical tech moves on, meaning today’s work is often obsolete by tomorrow. real eternity is only reserved for particularly stylised pieces of work, such as super mario world, journey or okami. players remember ‘photorealistic’ titles as how we wanted them to appear at the time, not as they were. look at something like grand theft auto san andreas, or doom, today – peerless games at the time of their release and classics to this very day – and you’ll wonder how your stupid brain ever convinced yourself they were immersive. the landscapes are empty. the character models look crap. your brain was lying to you. and so we come to the last of us part i – the revered and remade third-person action-adventure game from naughty dog. such is the pedigree attached to this post-apocalyptic epic that hbo – the same tv pioneer that brought you the wire, the sopranos, house of the dragon and, erm, entourage – has picked up the story for a properly prestige series that’s due out next year. hell, even the mandalorian himself pedro pascal has been brought in to anchor the thing. in its new and a new hope-d guise (it was initially just called the last of us), part i is designed as a comparable double bill to its 2020 sequel. you can now seamlessly transition between the two, without the awkward seven-year deficit in technological capabilities. it completely succeeds in its aims with ludicrously detailed character models, the kind of lighting fidelity that sony’s playstation 5 was made to showcase and a laudably extensive array of accessibility options to ensure everyone who wants to wallow in its existential misery (and moments of precious levity) can do so. and while probably still not timeless, part i successfully meets, and even succeeds, our own memories of it. it consistently looks even better than the last of us part ii. but what more is there to say about a game discussed more than perhaps any other in the last ten years? anyone who’s played – and liked – the last of us knows that it establishes some of the richest and most human characters in the medium. the story pulls no punches in its depiction of a world collapsing as a viral fungus ravages what’s left of civilisation. playing as hardened smuggler joel, you take a cross-country trip with a young girl called ellie, and in the process develop a relationship beyond akin to fatherhood. it’s a simple story told wonderfully well, and the various beats throughout are still impactful, emotional, and brutally effective. for newcomers, this is without question the definitive way to play one of the best games ever made. much debate has been had over whether sony is justified in charging a premium price of £70 for a remade product – one that’s even had its original multiplayer mode ripped out in service of the upcoming the last of us online. but having now played the remake once and a half times through, including its additional epilogue, left behind, there is enough value in playing this game in the way its developers intend in the modern era. seeing the world fall apart in its opening moments, all the way through to the iconic, unforgivable choices made toward the end of the story, all rendered at today’s level of graphical fidelity. the increase in atmosphere and emotion brought about by better facial capture and environmental detail is fully worth the price of admission. for players returning for a second, third, maybe even tenth replay, it’s the thematic and character touches that make replaying part i all the more enjoyable. especially in hindsight of the sequel. while boston, pittsburgh and salt lake city look better than ever, the real revelation here is how part ii’s shocking events gives this original game a new weight and resonance. character motives, dialogue, and major choices are all received with even greater gravitas once you understand what transpires in the double-length story of the second game. replaying part i felt like being given new information on characters you already know, and the companion piece nature of these two games has never felt more deliberate and considered. as you’d expect, the gameplay remains largely the same. a handful of upgrades to enemy ai and what seems to be animation blending do their bit to further elevate famously tense combat scenes, while an updated audio engine makes headshots feel brutal – my sonos arc has never shaken my living room so severely. it’s further enforced by a young ellie squealing “fuckkkkk” when you blow someone’s brains away. add in some subtle tweaks to certain moments that keep them super effective (or utterly terrifying in the case of a certain hotel basement’s power generator) and you’ve got a campaign that feels fresh enough to return to all over again. is all of this worth £70? that’s entirely up to you to decide. with the original game approaching a decade old, and that hbo adaptation arriving some time in 2023, it’s no surprise that part i has been revived for modern audiences. much to our own surprise, what playing this remake taught us was that we’re totally fine with the idea of it. this is the sort of treatment the best games demand, and the closest to timeless that they’ll ever come. the last of us deserves nothing less.
